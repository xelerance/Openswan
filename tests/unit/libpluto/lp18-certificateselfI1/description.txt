This test case is an IKEv2 initiator -- it uses a certificate with a wildcard
right= policy that accepts any ID that is properly validated.  It is
otherwise identical to lp14.

In this test case, the policy is to permit an initiator from %any to propose
a tunnel to that end point (the /32).

This series of tests also uses ike= with 3des and md5, modp1024 to override
defaults.  (WHY?)
