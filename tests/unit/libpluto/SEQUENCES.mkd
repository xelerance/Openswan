These test cases do IKEv2 with RSA keys, using whatever the built-in, default policy is.
Almost all subsequent tests are built upon these tests.

Status: working.

lp11-parentI2dup
----------------
This test determines what happens if the R1 message is duplicated for some
reason.

lp06-parentR1nochosen
---------------------
This test determines what happens when the responder has no matching policy.

lp72-msg1nopropchosen
---------------------
This test determines what happens when the responder chooses no proposal,
but the initiator sends some additional messages.

initiateself
============

A key part of Opportunistic Encryption and other uses is that the policy
allow a remote entity to create a policy for itself only.  That is, IPv4 /32,
or IPv6/128.

certificateself
===============

This series of tests uses a certificate with a policy for /32.  This requires
that the general policy (a template) be instantiated into a specific policy.

davecert
========

This series builds upon the certificateself sequence above, but it adds a
second initiator to the process in order to test that states and policy
are correctly split up.

                                      lp70-certreplydaveR1

ikev1
=====

The series tests IKEv1 mechanism.  The first of these was created to verify
that IKEv1 proposals are reject properly when IKEv2 mode, but the rest
were added to validate IKEv1 functionality.
