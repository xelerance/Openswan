This test case is an IKEv2 responder.
In this test case, the policy is to permit an initiator from %any to propose
a tunnel to that end point (the /32).

This test case receives a second (I2) packet from the initiator, which is
where the CHILD SA policy is processed.  An associated lp14-initiatorany
test case sets up the PARENT SA policy.

The UNIT1/R2-dump test with packet from parentI2_allzero.pcap proposes a TSi
of 0.0.0.0-0.0.0.0, that is the uninitialized TSi, which is wrong, and
should be rejected.

The UNIT2/R2-any test with packet from parentI2.pcap proposes a TSi which
is example.com (93.184.216.34/32) to a policy of %any.
