This test case is an IKEv2 initiator -- the public and private key are
contained in a certificate, but rightid=FQDN is set, so the IKEv2 ID will
be the FQDN, not the certificate DN.

This is the important I2 phase where the certificate and ID is sent.

Use "make pcapupdate" to update the R1 packet.
