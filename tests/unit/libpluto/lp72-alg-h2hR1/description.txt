Test cases lp71-lp74 work together to test a setup where the parent SA and
child SA have different algorithms.

This test case, a clone of lp37-h2hR1, is an IKEv2 responder.  This test case
is for a host to host (/32 to /32) connection.

h2hI1.pcap is copied from ../lp72-alg-h2hR1/OUTPUT/h2hI1.pcap.
(make pcapupdate will do this)
