This test case is an IKEv2 responder -- it uses a certificate with a wildcard
right= policy that accepts any ID that is properly (PKIX-chain) validated.
It is otherwise identical to lp17, except that now that policy is an ID wildcard.

In this test case, the policy is to permit an initiator from %any to propose
a tunnel to that end point (the /32).

parentI1.pcap is copied from ../lp18-certificateselfI1/OUTPUT/certificateselfI1.pcap
parentI2.pcap is copied from ../lp20-certificateselfI2/OUTPUT/certificateselfI2.pcap

The UNIT2/R2-dump test with packet from parentI2_allzero.pcap proposes a TSi
of 0.0.0.0-0.0.0.0, that is the uninitialized TSi, which is wrong, and
should be rejected.  This is UNITTEST2, and has output file: output2.txt.
UNIT2/R2 has been disabled because updating the _allzero.pcap error input is
difficult to do.

The UNIT1/R2-any test with packet from parentI2.pcap proposes a TSi which
is example.com (93.184.216.34/32) to a policy of %any.
This is UNITTEST1, and has output file: output1.txt.
