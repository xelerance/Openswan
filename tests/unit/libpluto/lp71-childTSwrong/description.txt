This test case is an IKEv2 responder for an initiator which is behind a NAT.
This test case is identical to lp64-nattR2, but the traffic selectors are not
compatible, resulting in a child_sa_respond returning NO_PROPOSAL_CHOSEN,
which should be sent as a notify along with the authenticated R2.
(Since the connection authenticated correctly, it just was wrong TS)

Since the connection is authenticated, the NO PROPOSAL CHOSEN Notify should
be sent as part of the encrypted response to the R2.
