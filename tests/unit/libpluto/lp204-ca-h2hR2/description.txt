Test cases lp201-lp204 work together to test a setup where the parent SA and
child SA have different algorithms.

This test case, a clone of lp39-h2hR2, is an IKEv2 responder, R2 for a policy
that is host to host.

h2hR2.pcap is copied from ../lp203-ca-h2hI2/OUTPUT/h2hR2.pcap.
make pcapupdate will do this.
