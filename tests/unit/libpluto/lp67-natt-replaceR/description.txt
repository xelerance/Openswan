This test case is a continuation of lp61,lp62,lp63,lp64,lp65, where the
initiator is behind NAT.

In this test case, the IKEv2 original responder is attempting to replace the
IKE (parent) SA.  The action is triggered through EVENT_SA_REPLACE.  Because
doing so would prevent further communication with the NAT'ed peer, pluto
ignores the event.  The responder elects to have the initiator take action,
and no packets are emitted.

This test case uses I1/I2 pcap files from lp61~lp65.
