This test case is an IKEv2 responder.
In this test case, the policy is to permit an initiator from %any to propose
a tunnel to that end point (the /32).

This test case receives a second (I2) packet from the initiator, which is
where the CHILD SA policy is processed.  An associated lp14-initiatorany
test case sets up the PARENT SA policy.

The R2-any test with packet from parentI2.pcap proposes a TSi which
is example.com (93.184.216.34/32) to a policy of %any.
