This test case is an IKEv2 initiator that rekeys it's child SA after
establishing it.
This is the case where the responder replies with it's R1 packet, but
the initiator then asks for another rekey, which tickles a bug with
scheduling of the new state.

This uses the I1/R1/I2/R2/I3 pcap files from lp13-parentI3.
It uses the pair of CI1 packet producd by lp50.
