This test case is an IKEv2 responder.

In this test case, the policy is to permit an initiator from %any to propose
a tunnel to that end point (the /32).

The initiator is coming from a random IP address, (right=%any), and is going
to propose that IP address (/32) for the inside (rightsubnet=%self), but that's later in I2/R2.

This case should create an R1 packet that can be sent back to the initiator
for test case lp16-initiateselfchild.

parentI1.pcap is copied from ../lp14-initiateself/OUTPUT/parentI1.pcap.
