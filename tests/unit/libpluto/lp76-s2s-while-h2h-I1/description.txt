This test case, a clone of lp36-h2hI1, is an IKEv2 initiator -- this one tests
a subnet to subnet policy, while a similar host to host state exists.

This test does not currently continue through R1/I2/R2/I3, but stops at I1, as
it's meant to test that we create a unique parent SA state for this subnet to
subnet tunnel.
