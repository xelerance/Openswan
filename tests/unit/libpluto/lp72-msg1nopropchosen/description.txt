This test case is an IKEv2 responder.

This test case is identical to lp12-parentR2, but in this case the
responder did not chose any I1 proposal, and said so.
But the initiator WENT ON ANYWAY, and tried, and the responder should
have dropped all state from this initiator, rather than try to decrypt it.
