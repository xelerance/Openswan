This test case is an IKEv1 initiator.  The client is called alice.
It uses raw RSA keys.
Alice lives behind a NAT gateway and it attempts to create a tunnel to
a network 10.2.0.0/24 that is behind the gateway sun.

This reproduces a problem found in ikev1/rw-nat-cert, where the responder
changed the phase 2 proposal incorrectly:

sun pluto[25970]: "rw" #1: the peer proposed: 10.2.0.0/16:0/0 -> 10.1.0.10/32:0/0
sun pluto[25970]: "rw" #2: responding to Quick Mode proposal {msgid:22ac6853}
sun pluto[25970]: "rw" #2:     us: 10.2.0.0/16===192.168.0.2[sun@strongswan.org]
sun pluto[25970]: "rw" #2:   them: %any[alice@strongswan.org]
