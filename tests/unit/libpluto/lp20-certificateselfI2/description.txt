This test case is an IKEv2 initiator -- it uses a certificate with a wildcard
right= policy that accepts any ID that is properly validated.
It is otherwise identical to lp16.
This is the I2 step.

In this test case, the policy is to permit an initiator from %any to propose
a tunnel to that end point (the /32).
