This test case is an IKEv2 initiator on I2.
This uses the proper cryptographic options to form a *signature*
(the DH is still link seamed to constants).

In this test case, there are two keys loaded, and pluto must pick
the one that corresponds to the public mentioned in leftrsasigkey=.

It is a copy of lp10-parentI2 and ct10.
