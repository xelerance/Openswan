This test case is an IKEv2 initiator on I2.
This uses the proper cryptographic options to form a *signature*
(the DH is still link seamed to constants).

In this test case, there are two keys loaded (via twosecrets.secrets),
and pluto must pick the one that corresponds to the public mentioned in
leftrsasigkey=.  This is key: AQN7wUerV, the 2048 bit one.

It is a copy of lp10-parentI2 and ct10.
