This test case is an IKEv2 responder. This test is identical in concept to
lp12-parentR2, except that when generating the reply, it uses the proper
cryptographic routines.

This test case receives a second (I2) packet from the initiator.
To set up, it must receive an I1, reply to that, and then process the I2.
