This is the first policy test cases that deals with matching of Traffic
Selectors against loaded policy.

This test case will become a template for future tests, and will be split
up the way that lp10/lp12/lp13 are, but for the moment it's a monolith.

It does not deal with IKE state or pcap files in or out.

It simply loads up a policy, picks an end via orient(), and then runs traffic
selectors (hard code in C for now) against the ikev2_child_sa_respond().
