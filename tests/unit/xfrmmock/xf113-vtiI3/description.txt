This test case is an IKEv2 initiator.
It tests crypto operations along the entire path, and it shows the
Virtual Tunnel Interface (VTI) value sent into the kernel.
The VTI or "tundev" value is a fwmark value that helps determine the policy.

This test specifically captures the netlink commands which are sent
and validates that the IPsec (CHILD, phase2) derived keys and algorithms are
sane.
It differs from XF13-parentI3, in that the tunnel dev value is forced in.
