This test case is an IKEv1 initiator, using main mode, sending the QI1 packet.
This test receives the R3 main mode packet from the responder, and sends the
first quick Q1 packet.  It uses in-band certificates and locks the policy to
ancient 3des-MD5.
This part of the test validates the phase2alg= setting as well.
