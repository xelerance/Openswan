# Openswan algorithm parsing library for pluto
#
# mostly contains minor support items that are placed here to make unit testing
# of pluto easier. Generally, this code can depend upon -lopenswan, and -loswlog,
# it should not depend upon anything else (ideally, including other code in this
# this library)
