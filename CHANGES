* Bugtracker bugs fixed
  #460: Fix bogus header with delayed MAIN I2->R2 [Herbert Xu]
  #496: kernel_alg_esp_auth_ok() call fixed - [gernot]
  #761: pluto crashes after removing interface [Tillman Baumann]
  #897/731: crash in alg_info_snprint() - ["Deep Throat"]
  #889: backport from #ikev2 branch to fix ipsec_delete_sa with NETKEY [mcr]

#ikev2
* IKEv2 support

#stable
* Merged in XAUTH DNS/WINS server-side patch from Anna Wiejak [paul]
  See: http://popoludnica.pl/?id=10100110 
* Various fixes to the scripts for NETKEY [paul]
* KLIPS support for the 2.6.23+ UDP ENCAP sockets [mcr]
  Userland support not yet finished. This should obsolete the NAT-T patch
  when finished.
* incorporated changes between 2.4.8 and 2.4.9
* incorporated changes between 2.4.9 and 2.4.10
* Notice and gracefully fail to load KLIPS when we try to load esp/ah/ipcomp
  protocol and another module already has registered these (eg esp4, ah4,
  ipcomp) [paul]
* Fix for KLIPS NAT-T dropping all packets on 64bit big endian machines [dhr]
* FIx for KLIPS on 2.6.23.1 without CONFIG_NF_CONNTRACK* [paul]
* Bugtracker bugs fixed:
  #600: multiple definitions of passert_fail when cross-compiling.
  #852: dd_connection() fails with ...not AH+ESP for type=passthrough conns
  #708: vanilla kernel-2.6.19, KLIPS compile error (sock_unregister) [sergeil]
  #654: XAUTH strips space out of username/password + patch [Dustin Lang]
  #641: Herein patches to fix warnings if -Wshadow is used [andygay/paul]

  #590: serpent lib used private kernel header [paul]
  #544: the following error should only show up for x509 debugging: ... [paul]
  #185: Deadlock in function "scx_release()" daemon pluto.(SMARTCARD) [Kurodo]

v2.5.15
   change ipsec_breakroute to permit non-existant eroute's to be replaced.  
   fix for NAT-T negotiation with IP address changes during negotiation.
   adjusted addconn to support nat-t debug keywords.

v2.5.14
   failed attempt to fix ipsec_breakroute.
   fixed leftsendcert= to be implemented in keyword parser.
   introduced startnetkey functions.
   UML kernel configuration canonicalization updated.

v2.5.13
   move DNS lookups from libipsecconf into pluto, where they belong. DNS lookups
	are still only done once during conn load time, and are done synchronously.

v2.5.12
   A fix to detect that XEN has been patched into the kernel, and set
   some of the 2.6.18 changes.
   never log starter_log() things to stdout, they always go to stderr.
   when a packet is passed through, do not call NF_IP_LOCAL_OUT, as it has already 
	passed through the output hooks, and doing it again, confuses things
	causing ip_route_me_harder() which creates a look, since it does the flow
	lookup again. (This doesn't happen if the kernel hasn't got XFRM support)
   fixed parsing of config file so that "version 2" is accepted.
   fixed addconn to respect "right/left"sourceip=, new test case sourceip-01 
   fixed processing of "first"/"last" packet for %trap/%hold conns in KLIPS, it now
	properly forwards the packets when the packet is released.
   

v2.5.11
   Some fixes in KLIPS for "ipsec eroute --clear" bug. It is not clear
   why this suddendly became an issue, or if it would have been an issue
   previously, given the right compiler optimization.
   
v2.5.10
   Includes fixes for xmlto generation for _confread directory.

v2.5.09
   Minor fix to build process, updated CHANGES file.

v2.5.08
   Correct release.
   Includes some changes to permit OE to work without nexthop,
   however this seems to cause it to return an unreachable on 
   the first message.

v2.5.07	-dud due to release script error.

v2.5.06
   set LANGUAGE, LANG and LC_ALL in setup script.
   change OE off by default note and scripts.
   Merge of additional code from 2.4.
   
v2.5.05
   2.5.03 and 2.5.04 were not properly released, and 2.5.05 now
   is properly released and includes below items
    
v2.5.04
    zero peer_ca to avoid crashes.
    (include glob's may still not work correctly)

v2.5.03
    ipsec.conf parsing should ignore keywords that start with x-
	they are a form of structured comment.
    added in forceencaps= keyword.
    process wildcards with glob() in include statements.

v2.5.02
    fixed bug in ipsec.conf parser, where it could not read values
       that had = in them (such as base64 encoded keys)
    fixed bug in key continuation code that could cause a crash
	if the DNS request timed out after the state was deleted
	for other reasons.
 
v2.5.01
    merged xauthusername code base + multinet tests in.
    removed /dev/hw_random from list of valid random sources on linux.
        use "rngd" instead to feed /dev/random.

v2.5.00 
    fixed various bugs with lifetime values in ipsec.conf parser
    AES-128 (group 5, MD5 or SHA1 for PRF) is now accepted for phase 1,
	and it is now the preferred cipher as well. This should be the
	case for Main mode, Aggressive mode, and for XAUTH client and
	XAUTH server, and PSK and RSA sig mode.

    fixes so that starter will now compile
    move whacklib to lib/libwhack
    adjust makefiles to work with OBJDIR version of Makefile.program
    switch to OBJDIR in programs/* and lib/* if it is defined

    added sanitizer for PID files
    be smarter about including git version info into version
    We need to use /dev/urandom first, as it has more random than /dev/random.
       Otherwise, we run out really fast (within a few minutes)
    Use endian.h when comiling out-of-kernel
    patch to turn error about 17/500,0/0 vs 17/0 error with Cisco VPN3000
       into a warning.
    remove test for NAT-T VID vs NATD payload test. It fails for reasons
       that are unknown at this time, and this check is really being pedantic.
    MAJOR: use starter code for "addconn"
    MAJOR: always use OBJDIRs, and compile on Windows (no kernel)
    MAJOR: includes "Taproom" code --- TCL call outs from pluto at IKE
		transition states. 

v2.4.10
* Fix for sock.sk_stamp type change in 2.6.22 [dhr]
* Workaround for implementations that propose port 0 for l2tp to allow
  us to connect to all their ports (instead of only 1701). This happens
  with Cisco VPN 3000, OSX and Windows XP. This relates to various
  reported bugs about rightprotoport=17/%any and CK_INSTANCE crashers [mcr]
  Use the workaround for OSX clients using rightprotoport=17/0
* Backport of fix for xauth name containing a space [paul]
