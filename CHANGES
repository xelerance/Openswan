* guard against multiple inclusion of pluto/log.h (in order to build on CentOS) [MCR]

v2.6.47 (March 28, 2016)

Added feature to allow DNS query for external IP address of a gateway.

* Make certificate directories in correct place [MCR]
* Order of addconn and pluto is non-deterministic, so stick addconn output elsewhere [MCR]
* As a result of change to orient with family=0, this test case now binds an interface [MCR]
* With revision to permit left=%any, right=%defaultroute, and orient by
  private key it is permissible to have a conn that does not specify a host
  IP for "our side" [MCR]
* When looking for a matching interface, and conn family is 0, and both ends
  are zero, just pick the first interface that matches on ports [MCR]
* Initial test case for loading connection with right=%defaultroute [MCR]
* Exit if connection not found, rather than core dump later [MCR]
* Clean out .o files [MCR]
* Test case on why defaultroute is not a valid IP address: discovered in
  DrTaylorPlumage with ikev1-double-nat [MCR]
* Created functional test case for loading a mixed v6 in v4 conn [MCR]
* Created new test case for loading and orientating a mixed v6 in v4 conn [MCR]

* Some missing leaks [MCR]
* With port numbers in play, the desired_port may not be set, in which case, look for plutos port [MCR]
* Change log to indicate a match on IP, going along with match on private key [MCR]
* The NO_KERNEL interface type was originally intended for pluto functional
  testing, and so it has some cruft related to not matching port numbers
  against 500. This presents problems when unit testing with (fake) ports
  other than 500, and so really the ignoring of port numbers should be a
  seperately enabled feature, as the unit testing really needs to use the
  actual NO_KERNEL interface, since it has no kernel [MCR]
* Added additional interface for port 4500 [MCR]
* Try to pick matching port when picking an interface [MCR]
* When picking an appropriate interface, make sure that the port numbers match [MCR]
* Updated test cases for logging of IP address in orient test [MCR]
* Turn off IPv6 since mock output code does not speak IPv6. [MCR]
* Bit a bit more flexible in where the address family comes from, and log the
  resulting interface better [MCR]
* Fixed order of htons() and init_iface_port, and added include for inet_pton [MCR]
* Provide for optional INIT_LOADED to be called. Used in lp18 for assert [MCR]
* More extensive debug of orient() --- log which private key was found, and
  also if the pick_interface was able to find an interface. Also change the
  family searched for to be the (derived) value for the connection, rather
  than the end [MCR]
* Provide example of how to translate enum to string for keyword_host [MCR]
* Updates to lp18 for revised debugging of orient [MCR]
* Use preformatted interface address [MCR]
* Pick an interface that matches the right family [MCR]
* Reformat comments [MCR]
* Added ip_oriented flag to indicate if orientation was bound to IP [MCR]
* Added init_iface_port to include setting of q->socktypename [MCR]
* lp31 discovered that addrtypeof, addrbytesptr and samaddr should be tolerant
  of receiving a NULL [MCR]
* Changes to fmt_connection means that the nexthop for right=%any is no longer
  guess/assumed or logged [MCR]
* The changes to the conn load verification for IKEv1 PSK right=%any should use
  a left=%any, rather than an explicit address. [MCR]
* Change update_host_pair to return indicate of whether orient worked; as if
  it did not then a different address might be in order. [MCR]
* Updates to unit test cases for socktypename addition [MCR]
* Added socknametype to iface_port structure so that socket family can easily be logged [MCR]
* Make it clear that IPHOSTNAME types are not v4 or v6, and should not
  initialize the nexthop in any specific way, and should fit into the
  right=%any checks for IKEv1 as well [MCR]
* Try to guess what kind of family the conn is, if the conn has a this or that
  with a family set the host for the side that does not have a family to
  that family [MCR]
* Try to set the address family from left or from right, if set. [MCR]
* Only diagnose an address-type mis-match if both sides are specified by a literal address [MCR]
* Check for core dumps. Write test case 2b into gdbinit file [MCR]
* Arbitrarily decide to use IPv6 ANY address when right is default route [MCR]
* Set the address type based upon which kind of address was parsed [MCR]
* Also validate that the conn is properly loaded into pluto [MCR]
* Correctly parse a site local (e.g. fec0::1) address [MCR]
* New test case to validate IPv6 site local addresses in left/right= [MCR]
* Log the string value involved in the debug of the looseenum [MCR]
* IPv6 address of cassidy.sandelman.ca actually did change [MCR]
* lp40 updated for DNS delayed rebase [MCR]
* find_ID_host_pair debug now includes dump of exact parameter [MCR]
* Check the orientations after the secrets are loaded, as
  possession-of-private-key test needs private keys [MCR]
* Removed confusing comment [MCR]
* Changes to conn to be really h2h [MCR]
* Orient test which loads keys after conns [MCR]
* h2h should use host to host items [MCR]
* Added h2h and brokenspace as possible test cases for readwriteconf crash [MCR]
* Change connection list as per DNS changes to show IP address discovered [MCR]
* gcc 5.0 fixes [MCR]
* Reconciled leak of ID to fact that IDhost_pair is never freed [MCR]
* Update lp08 with proper CHILDSA_DEL name for state, after state_names added [MCR]
* Updated description to explain three unit subtests [MCR]
* There was a IDhost_pair leak, which was located, as one list was never
  properly emptied as the clear_host_pair routine was incorrectly calling
  the host_pair free routine when it meant to remove a connection from a list [MCR]
* Updated Makefile and explanation of how to get updated pcap file [MCR]
* Unit tests do not speak 3des-md5, modp1024 [MCR]
* Make sure the installed_time for a public key is set from regression controlled time [MCR]
* Updated parameters for test case to match files named after tests [MCR]
* A half-open, prospective_parent_sa that is in progress only gets priority
  over new DNS answers, if the DNS query had an error [MCR]
* If no addresses are available from DNS yet, but there is a hint, then the
  hint should be attempted [MCR]
* Protect connection_check_ddns1 against corrupt IPhp_next loops [MCR]
* Try to be smarter about when a connection is stuck: consider connections
  which have never come up as well [MCR]
* Blacklist a bunch of replies for DNS lookups [MCR]
* In order to avoid DNS errors causing more DNS lookups, only do new DNS
  lookups when there is a timeout --- other attempts will use additional
  addresses only [MCR]
* Have adns return getaddrinfo()-style EAI errors, even for old nquery work [MCR]
* Be careful not to remove connections which were not yet added to host_pair [MCR]

* Slight tweak to comment [MCR]
* Make sure to set the DNS list pointer upon receiving new answers [MCR]
* Guard against no connections in search routine [MCR]
* Added additional debugging to delayed DNS lookup continuation [MCR]
* Init generic CR before filling in DNS name so that qtid gets logged sanely [MCR]
* Keep track of states that are created to potentially bring up a parent SA.
  This is needed to tell if there is an ongoing initiation for a delayed-DNS
  effort, or if one should be made. Do not make an attempt to bring up the
  conn unless the policy is set to UP.  Use returned state number from the
  initiate process to always get correct state in test harness [MCR]
* Make test validate that handle_adns_answer() does not cause conn to be set to UP [MCR]
* Make clean would clean up whackfile, so on reffile use, cp it to OUTPUT [MCR]

  of records to lookup (A vs AAAA) [MCR]
* Added seam_initiate and seam_adns appropriate to fix up tests [MCR]
* Do DNS lookup and then initiate connection [MCR]
* Whitespace changes [MCR]
* Split up sendI1 so continuation part can be called again [MCR]
* Move kick_adns_connection from dnskey to initiate [MCR]
* Reworked lp33 to include actual initiate and dns continuation code [MCR]
* Create kick_adns_connection routine so that DNS replies kick new
  connections immediately [MCR]
* Copy parentI1 main code into lp33 and add aDNS steps [MCR]
* Added A and AAAA records to rr_typename [MCR]
* Remember if an end has a valid address when DNS lookups are delayed so
  that we do not initiate until DNS lookups have had a chance [MCR]
* Rearranged a bunch of seam so that lp33 can import real adns code properly [MCR]
* Removed include of connections.c, use connections.o: add set of includes [MCR]
* Include seam_dnskey explicitly, as test case 33 will use real code [MCR]
* Updates after rebase [MCR]
* Add test case lp33 for dns delayed, when there is no hint [MCR]
* For unclear reasons the lookup of cassidy.sandelman.ca/KEY RR fails. Could
  be due to obsolete RR? [MCR]

* Rename lp27-IDhostpair to lp31 to keep sequence [MCR]
* Tweak lp30-dnskick [MCR]
* Tweak seam_log [MCR]
* Test pcap output now uses TESTNAME, so set it correctly [MCR]
* Clean up PID file, and create .gdbinit with arguments [MCR]
* Deal with some leaks; use stop_adns() properly to clear up children.
  Make sure that ipanswers list, after sorting, is restored so that all
  items get freed (affects regression testing) [MCR]
* Process each dns request before making a new one to keep order the same [MCR]
* Use sort_addr_info to canonicalize the output to deal with differences in gai.conf [MCR]
* Added make explicitly to package list [MCR]
* Use DBG_log to get consistent output [MCR]
* As structure is used as temporary, and copied, make sure to zero it first [MCR]
* Output results if failure [MCR]
* Adjust unit test cases for update_host_pair() seam. Rename lp28-dns to
  lp30-dnskick, add needed canonicalization. Adjust output from moving
  dump_addr_info() into pluto as it uses DBG_log() rather than printf(),
  and outputs to stderr [MCR]
* Removed last vestiges of DYNAMICDNS and processing converted to IPHOSTNAME [MCR]
* Tweak adnstest [MCR]
* Process DNS getaddrinfo() replies, and attach them to continuation [MCR]

* Make certificate directories; removed --adns path argument from help [MCR]
* Move test for SAref and SAbind into kernel.c [MCR]
* Added setproctitle() [from BSD licensed sendmail via pppd] and use it rather
  than global_argv hack. Use setproctitle() in adns sub-process [MCR]
* Create dummy kick_adns_connection [MCR]
* _pluto_adns is no longer a seperate program, but is part of the pluto
  executable, forked out for use. This makes it much easier for embedded
  systems to have a sane (if simple) async DNS resolver. Future work will
  switch to c-ares This patch also includes changing progname to a const
  globally [MCR]

  in a functional test [MCR]
* Figure out left/right-ness of keyword so that it can be logged better in errors [MCR]
* Added loose_enumarg processing [MCR]
* When setup properly, the h2hR2 test case works fine: just needs to have actual keys [MCR]

* h2h R2 packet processing - broken [MCR]
* Make output file parameterized by testname [MCR]
* h2h I2 packet processing [MCR]
* Make lp10 a template test case [MCR]
* Make output file parameterized by testname [MCR]
* h2h R1 packet processing [MCR]

   as a result of an instance being created/copied from the parent, without
   clearing the IDhost_pair link [MCR]
*  Use SHA1_DIGEST_SIZE rather than incorrect sizeof() [MCR]
*  Protected ietf_constants.h against multiple inclusion [MCR]
*  Some code was duplicated due to refactoring that was backported: list_rm moved to hostpair.h [MCR]
*  TIME_UTC is also defined in /usr/include/time.h, so pick a better name [MCR]
*  GCC 5.0 complains about use of !same_chunk() because expansion of macro leaves it confused. Add () [MCR]
*  Protect list_rm against ehead being null [MCR]
*  Remove cleanup of IDhostpair links to hostpair.c,
    and protect against the connection having never been on an ID hostpair [MCR]
*  Fixed problem in check_connection_end where wrong end was tested for [MCR]
*  As SPD Route may be manipulated before being erouted, the resulting eroute_owner setting is no longer propogated back into the connection
   this patch sets all SPD routes which do not have other owners to this eroute [MCR]
*  Log eroute operations more concisely, do it after they succeed/fail [MCR]
*  Better logging of eroute_owner [MCR]
*  Refactor show_connection_status so that it can use loglog or whacklog for output
   moved log.h to pluto/log.h as unit test cases will need it [MCR]
*  Log current date when processing events [MCR]
*  Looks like a copy and paste error has lingered in the sourceip processing, causing the parser
   to whomp on the nexthop if the sourceip is set [MCR]

 * Change negotiated tunnel message to be clearer with IPv6 addresses [MCR]
 *  Using short notation, using GNUmakefile notdir, and making sure that $< will
    reference the right file by making explicit %.c->%.o rule. [Jason]
 *  Show the connection name when the state is found, provide a way to nicely dump a single state to debug log [MCR]
 *  Change find_host_pair so that it knows if it is creating a new host pair, as host pairs that have right=%any will always match [MCR]
 *  Tweak CA business so that correct CA is loaded, it is referenced correctly, the correct ID is used to lookup the CA [MCR]
 *  Make sure that certificate file name is properly terminated [MCR]

 *  Make passing pass_prompt_t into key loading function officially optional [MCR]
 *  Cope with a NULL prompt_pass, make something up to store passphrase if necessary [MCR]
 *  Adopted some kernel_netkey.c fixes from libreswan, and added some debug of port numbers [MCR]
 *  Reset the remote port number to 0, as lack of client should indicate lack of port numbers (XXX maybe not) [MCR]
 *  rw_instantiate needs to take remote address from state [MCR]
 *  Simplify evaluation of when we need to instantiate templates: all conns that
    are templates should be instantiated [MCR]

 *  Added explicit struct end that to ipsec installation to deal with rightsubnet=%self situation [MCR]
 *  find_client_connection can use endclient too [MCR]
 *  Note better when find_host_pair() is done [MCR]

 *  Use endclienttot() to format things in more places [MCR]
 *  Use endclienttot() to print fc_try debug [MCR]
 *  Added enddclienttot() function to format end->client, taking into account that the host_type might be %any [MCR]
 *  Need to set send_whack_msg to a value even if ctlbase is going to default [MCR]
 *  Log when there is no send_whack_msg function [MCR]
 *  Do not even try to use libnss for certain non-critical PEM related 3DES operations [MCR]
 *  Make sure that st_localaddr and st_localport is setup based upon where we observe traffic to flow
    this information is used when has_client=0, and we are really proposing a conn for self. [MCR]
 *  If end has no client, then set end to appropriate value from state [MCR]
 *  Correctly return no proposal chosen when the initiator suggests 0.0.0.0->0.0.0.0,
    which previously matched encoding for %any [MCR]

    address could determine orientation) [MCR]
 *  Split nss and non-nss signature routines [MCR]
 *  Explain liboswkeys library [MCR]
 *  Explain libpluto [MCR]
 *  Make connection loading description a bit prettier [MCR]
 *  Module mis-named, got an i in front of af_key [MCR]
 *  Clean up orient info -- debug only [MCR]
 *  Warn about FIPS mode only once [MCR]
 *  libnss brings in some additional libraries that reveals that rsasigkey does not have exit_tool() defined [MCR]

 *  Make ikeping diagnostics saner, and show help rather than aborting [MCR]
 *  Update IPSECBASEVERSION in Makefile.ver for packagingprep target (simon)
 *  Make ikeping diagnostics saner, and show help rather than aborting [MCR]
 *  Clarify that whack_magic mismatch has nothing to do with klips [MCR]
 *  Permit debug-netkey to be alias for debug-klips as well debug-xfrm [MCR]

 * Log src/dst after it is inbound/outbound set [MCR]
 * Take IPsec SA end points from state rather than from policy [MCR]
 * Pass parent state down in IPsec SA creation routines so that an accurate st_localaddr/st_remoteaddr is available.
      Note should also add port numbers --- IKEv2 NAT work is probably still open [MCR]
 * Some debug of setup_half_ipsec_sa [MCR]
 * SA src/dst is not a subnet, but an address, so use appropriate structure [MCR]
 * Log algorithm lookup in KLIPS debug, and also IP address pairs of endpoint [MCR]
 * When responding in an error condition, keep the state around awhile
   in case there is a retransmit; but eventually remove it [MCR]
 * Always collect other peers SPI value, we need it. With this change, the spi=0000000 problem goes away [MCR]
 * Moved detection that responder has sent multiple proposals outside of block that matches them [MCR]
 * Role can never change in ikev2parent_inR2, it is always the initiator [MCR]
 * Added progress debug to setup_half_ipsec_sa so errors from kernel make more sense [MCR]
 * Removed role parameter from emit_ts, and move next_payload calculation to parent [MCR]
 * Removed note about duplicate_state --- state duplication occurs in ike_child_sa_respond [MCR]
 * Defend ikev2_encrypt_msg against possible bad inputs; might come from ikev2_delete_out [MCR]
 * Make code associated with being a responder not optional [MCR]

   was being compared on child SA, rather than parent [MCR]
 * Do not log NAT port changes if original address is 0.0.0.0 [MCR]
 * Import libreswan (2bc8abe3) netlink fixes [MCR]
 * Make sigusr1 handler static [MCR]
 * Added DEBUG_WITH_PAUSE to keep pluto from running away with retransmits
   when developer is thinking after a failure [MCR]
 * Adopt a bunch of IKE algorithm definitions, and attempt to
    find and quiet source of duplicate algorithm entries [MCR]
 * Refactor ESP creation into new function for readability [MCR]
 * Pluto now accepts SIGUSR1: this presently does nothing (crypto subprocesses ignore it)
    it can be used with DEBUG_WITH_PAUSE to "single step" pluto interactions which are going
    too fast to figure manually inspect.
    In particular, one can do "ipsec whack --status" on the peer before letting the processing
    proceed. [MCR]
 * Note in logs when parentSA is considered good [MCR]
 * Disentangle LIBNSS and non-LIBNSS code [MCR]
 * Convert some uses of whack_log to loglog() so that they go into system log too! [MCR]
 * Log the IKE version in state, and if v2-parent, log the msgid counters [MCR]
 * State_hash now returns the bucket number, which can aid in certain kinds of debugging [MCR]
 * Some minor comments about msgid processing
    make sure that if the msgid is too large or cookies do not match, that no further processing occurs [MCR]
 * Gave all the IKEv2 state microcodes a human readable name [MCR]
 * Found problems with mis-initialized st_msgid_nextuse, created new routing to allocate them from parent [MCR]
 * Added record of IKE maj/min version to state structure.
    Collect it in into the msgdigest, and insert into stats on receive/create-state, and initialize
    it when initiating. [MCR]
 * Found error in starter_whack_add_pubkey that resulted in public keys not loaded. This was
    introduced in commit: 0783e455 by mcr (me!) [MCR]
 * Improve documentation of starter_whack_build_pkmsg [MCR]
 * Set LOOSE_ENUM_OTHER values appropriate, and debug the result if desired [MCR]
 * Parser_loose_enum used to return explicit "255", which matches LOOSE_ENUM_OTHER
    as a value. But instead put the appropriate value into the keyword_def structure.
 * Not only is this more flexible, but it is much easier to understand [MCR]
 * Mark keyword_name() arg0 as const [MCR]
 * Adjust ikev1 for new find_host_connection ANY that takes histype [MCR]
 * Added KH_IPADDR to list of host type keywords [MCR]
 * Added histype to find_connection functions [MCR]
 * Some initial changes to put %any processing into host_pair code [MCR]
 * Log host type of remote side of conn in host_pair [MCR]
 * Changes to link order cause liboswlog to be properly linked in; this requires exit_tool
    and progname to be setup properly [MCR]
 * Import TS checking/narrowing code from libreswan into ikev2parent_inR2 [MCR]
 * Changed SEND_NOTIFICATION to SEND_V2_NOTIFICATION, from libreswan [MCR]
 * Ikev2_log_parentSA should be used on initiator and responder.
    It is a good candidate for a function that could be omitted when memory is tight [MCR]
 * Ikev2_process_payloads is wrong for processing and encrypted payload, do it inline [MCR]
 * Make sure that event is always deleted on free_state [MCR]
 * Added counter for number of retransmissions from responder seen [MCR]
 * Repeated payload problem fixed [MCR]
 * Notification should go to whack log, with appropriate value
    make sure to set the current state, and remove debugging of payloads seen [MCR]
 * Create a way to run parentI1 with calculations so that they can be saved (does not work yet) [MCR]
 * Always include RFC5144 groups, no more ifdef [MCR]
 * Split libnss code from non-libnss for better clarity [MCR]
    outR1 could well assign the header msgID from the initiator's messageID,
    but since the I1 messageID is defined to be zero, it should all be the same.
    The messageID is sequence in IKEv2, but in IKEv1, it's opaque, so handle htonl() here. [MCR]
 * Processing of v2N_INVALID_KE_PAYLOAD notify [MCR]
 * Now picks correct state when notify is seen [MCR]
 * ikeI1 state to deal with respondering sending a notify [MCR]
 * Add target to make assembly for examining underlying causes [MCR]
 * Do not delete state immediately, mark it as waiting to delete [MCR]
 * Permit the RHEL7 spec file to also build on RHEL6.5. xmlto otherwise can not resolve dependancy
    for lynx vs elinks. RHEL7 does not seem to have lynx [MCR]
 * Change log of state deletion to not be a debug, log state name too (idea from libreswan) [MCR]
 * Move spd formatting routines to library [MCR]
 * Split orient() function into new file so it can be tested [MCR]
 * When processing conf files, a missing right=/left= should cause an error and the conn should not be loaded [MCR]
 * Move orient function to libpluto.
    Pass it the pluto_port number to use, rather than reference a global [MCR]
 * Change pluto_port -> pluto_port500,
    introduce pluto_port4500. Make setting the pluto_port also set the NAT traversal port to +4000 of it.
    Do not hard code the port 4500, use IETF name for port 4500 [MCR]
 * New function: ikev2parent_outI1_withstate permits IKEv2 to start with some state [MCR]
 * Refactor pubkey addition process, add this to whack write [MCR]
 * Include option to create whack files from loaded conns [MCR]
 * Refactor serialization of whack message to reuse in readwriteconf [MCR]
 * Return count of messages read so that failures can more easily be diagnosed [MCR]
 * Move whack msg write functions to libpluto [MCR]
 * Make sure that the --secctx_attr_value is always accepted, and if appropriate, ignored [MCR]
 * Permit an explicit nhelpers=-1 [MCR]
 * Added family2str to decode AF_INET/AF_INET6 nicely [MCR]
 * Moved defs.h to include/pluto/defs.h, so change the include slightly [MCR]
 * Change some more variables to LIBFOO from FOOLIB [MCR]
 * A batch of libreswan configuration code was ported as it was noticed that there was some
    mix of strdup/clone_str already.
    Some keywords were imported, many were not yet imported.  The code is formatted vastly differently [MCR]
 * Refactor key building whack message processing [MCR]

 *  Use a more KLIPS-y way to detect if KLIPS is loaded; not ancient pfkey interface [MCR]
 *  While the uid  and pid types changes for namespace support since 3.12,
    rather than fix that, KLIPS really does not need to know the PID at all. [MCR]
 *  Compile out the pfkey /proc interfaces; they provide no value [MCR]
 *  Use IP_SELECT_IDENT_NEW for kernel 3.12 series [MCR]
 *  Replace the ipsec_proc interface with seq based interfaces [MCR]
 *  Patch to work with Linux 3.11,3.15 [MCR]

 *  Removed dead function: ikev2_narrow_instantiate [MCR]
 *  32-bit,64-bit issues with printf [MCR]
 *  Try to deal with -Wqual-cast/-Werror issues: addrbytesptr() should perhaps not be promising const-ness on ptr [MCR]
 *  NAT-T: new style uses setsockopt and old (KLIPS-only) uses ioctl [Simon Deziel]
 *  Use pidof instead of ps -C in _realsetup as the former is guarantied to
    be available even on minimal installs. Closes Debian bug #719126. [Simon Deziel]
 *  Update README to include dependencies for RH-based distros [Simon Deziel]
 *  Added SSL roadwarrior configuration [Renzo Dani]

v2.5.15 (Aug 14, 2007)
   change ipsec_breakroute to permit non-existant eroute's to be replaced.

v2.5.14 (Jul 19, 2007)
   failed attempt to fix ipsec_breakroute.
   fixed leftsendcert= to be implemented in keyword parser.
   introduced startnetkey functions.
   UML kernel configuration canonicalization updated.

v2.5.13 (May 7, 2007)
   move DNS lookups from libipsecconf into pluto, where they belong. DNS lookups
	are still only done once during conn load time, and are done synchronously.

v2.5.12 (Apr 30, 2007)
   A fix to detect that XEN has been patched into the kernel, and set
   some of the 2.6.18 changes.
   never log starter_log() things to stdout, they always go to stderr.
   when a packet is passed through, do not call NF_IP_LOCAL_OUT, as it has already
	passed through the output hooks, and doing it again, confuses things
	causing ip_route_me_harder() which creates a look, since it does the flow
	lookup again. (This doesn't happen if the kernel hasn't got XFRM support)
   fixed parsing of config file so that "version 2" is accepted.
   fixed addconn to respect "right/left"sourceip=, new test case sourceip-01
   fixed processing of "first"/"last" packet for %trap/%hold conns in KLIPS, it now
	properly forwards the packets when the packet is released.


v2.5.11 (Apr 19, 2007)
   Some fixes in KLIPS for "ipsec eroute --clear" bug. It is not clear
   why this suddendly became an issue, or if it would have been an issue
   previously, given the right compiler optimization.

v2.5.10 (Apr 2, 2007)
   Includes fixes for xmlto generation for _confread directory.

v2.5.09 (Apr 2, 2007)
   Minor fix to build process, updated CHANGES file.

v2.5.08 (Apr 2, 2007)
   Correct release.
   Includes some changes to permit OE to work without nexthop,
   however this seems to cause it to return an unreachable on
   the first message.

v2.5.07	-dud due to release script error.

v2.5.06 (?)
   set LANGUAGE, LANG and LC_ALL in setup script.
   change OE off by default note and scripts.
   Merge of additional code from 2.4.

v2.5.05 (Feb 14, 2007)
   2.5.03 and 2.5.04 were not properly released, and 2.5.05 now
   is properly released and includes below items

v2.5.04 (?)
    zero peer_ca to avoid crashes.
    (include glob's may still not work correctly)

v2.5.0sbs5 (Dec 12, 2005)
    fixed issues with libwhack not getting built with VIRTUAL_IP.
    adjusted programs/pluto/Makefile to depend upon libraries better

v2.5.0sbs4 (Dec 11, 2005)
    When a template conn is instantiated for a phase 1 configuration, it
	may still need to be adjusted to a virtual IP address. In addition,
	change the order of the virtual IP address setting and the
	port-wildcard processing.
        This patch also provides some additional debugging of the proposal
	which actually processed by the machinery.

    tests for L2TP+X.509 L2TP configuration --- 2 clients behind the
        same NAT with certificates that need to have their connection both
        instantiated (in phase 1) and virtualized (in phase 2).

v2.5.03 (Jan 10, 2007)

    ipsec.conf parsing should ignore keywords that start with x-
	they are a form of structured comment.
    added in forceencaps= keyword.
    process wildcards with glob() in include statements.

v2.5.02 (?)
    fixed bug in ipsec.conf parser, where it could not read values
       that had = in them (such as base64 encoded keys)
    fixed bug in key continuation code that could cause a crash
	if the DNS request timed out after the state was deleted
	for other reasons.

v2.5.01 (Jan 2, 2007)
    merged xauthusername code base + multinet tests in.
    removed /dev/hw_random from list of valid random sources on linux.
        use "rngd" instead to feed /dev/random.

v2.5.00 (Nov 2, 2006)
    fixed various bugs with lifetime values in ipsec.conf parser
    AES-128 (group 5, MD5 or SHA1 for PRF) is now accepted for phase 1,
	and it is now the preferred cipher as well. This should be the
	case for Main mode, Aggressive mode, and for XAUTH client and
	XAUTH server, and PSK and RSA sig mode.

    fixes so that starter will now compile
    move whacklib to lib/libwhack
    adjust makefiles to work with OBJDIR version of Makefile.program
    switch to OBJDIR in programs/* and lib/* if it is defined

    added sanitizer for PID files
    be smarter about including git version info into version
    We need to use /dev/urandom first, as it has more random than /dev/random.
       Otherwise, we run out really fast (within a few minutes)
    Use endian.h when comiling out-of-kernel
    patch to turn error about 17/500,0/0 vs 17/0 error with Cisco VPN3000
       into a warning.
    remove test for NAT-T VID vs NATD payload test. It fails for reasons
       that are unknown at this time, and this check is really being pedantic.
    MAJOR: use starter code for "addconn"
    MAJOR: always use OBJDIRs, and compile on Windows (no kernel)
    MAJOR: includes "Taproom" code --- TCL call outs from pluto at IKE
		transition states.

* Some workarounds for openwrt related to starter and lack of modprobe [paul]
* Fix for sock.sk_stamp type change in 2.6.22 [dhr]
