v2.6.47 (March 28, 2016)

Added feature to allow DNS query for external IP address of a gateway.

* Make certificate directories in correct place [MCR]
* Order of addconn and pluto is non-deterministic, so stick addconn output elsewhere [MCR]
* As a result of change to orient with family=0, this test case now binds an interface [MCR]

  private key it is permissible to have a conn that does not specify a host
  IP for "our side" [MCR]
* When looking for a matching interface, and conn family is 0, and both ends
  are zero, just pick the first interface that matches on ports [MCR]
* Initial test case for loading connection with right=%defaultroute [MCR]
* Exit if connection not found, rather than core dump later [MCR]
* Clean out .o files [MCR]

* Change log to indicate a match on IP, going along with match on private key [MCR]
* The NO_KERNEL interface type was originally intended for pluto functional
  testing, and so it has some cruft related to not matching port numbers
  against 500. This presents problems when unit testing with (fake) ports
  other than 500, and so really the ignoring of port numbers should be a
  seperately enabled feature, as the unit testing really needs to use the
  actual NO_KERNEL interface, since it has no kernel [MCR]

* Provide for optional INIT_LOADED to be called. Used in lp18 for assert [MCR]
* More extensive debug of orient() --- log which private key was found, and
  also if the pick_interface was able to find an interface. Also change the

  than the end [MCR]

* Added init_iface_port to include setting of q->socktypename [MCR]
* lp31 discovered that addrtypeof, addrbytesptr and samaddr should be tolerant
  of receiving a NULL [MCR]
* Changes to fmt_connection means that the nexthop for right=%any is no longer
  guess/assumed or logged [MCR]
* The changes to the conn load verification for IKEv1 PSK right=%any should use
  a left=%any, rather than an explicit address. [MCR]
* Change update_host_pair to return indicate of whether orient worked; as if
  it did not then a different address might be in order. [MCR]
* Updates to unit test cases for socktypename addition [MCR]
* Added socknametype to iface_port structure so that socket family can easily be logged [MCR]
* Make it clear that IPHOSTNAME types are not v4 or v6, and should not
  initialize the nexthop in any specific way, and should fit into the
  right=%any checks for IKEv1 as well [MCR]
* Try to guess what kind of family the conn is, if the conn has a this or that
  with a family set the host for the side that does not have a family to
  that family [MCR]

* Correctly parse a site local (e.g. fec0::1) address [MCR]
* New test case to validate IPv6 site local addresses in left/right= [MCR]
* Log the string value involved in the debug of the looseenum [MCR]
* IPv6 address of cassidy.sandelman.ca actually did change [MCR]
* lp40 updated for DNS delayed rebase [MCR]
* find_ID_host_pair debug now includes dump of exact parameter [MCR]
* Check the orientations after the secrets are loaded, as
  possession-of-private-key test needs private keys [MCR]
* Removed confusing comment [MCR]
* Changes to conn to be really h2h [MCR]
* Orient test which loads keys after conns [MCR]
* h2h should use host to host items [MCR]

* Update lp08 with proper CHILDSA_DEL name for state, after state_names added [MCR]
* Updated description to explain three unit subtests [MCR]

  properly emptied as the clear_host_pair routine was incorrectly calling
  the host_pair free routine when it meant to remove a connection from a list [MCR]
* Updated Makefile and explanation of how to get updated pcap file [MCR]
* Unit tests do not speak 3des-md5, modp1024 [MCR]
* Make sure the installed_time for a public key is set from regression controlled time [MCR]
* Updated parameters for test case to match files named after tests [MCR]
* A half-open, prospective_parent_sa that is in progress only gets priority
  over new DNS answers, if the DNS query had an error [MCR]
* If no addresses are available from DNS yet, but there is a hint, then the
  hint should be attempted [MCR]
* Protect connection_check_ddns1 against corrupt IPhp_next loops [MCR]
* Try to be smarter about when a connection is stuck: consider connections
  which have never come up as well [MCR]
* Blacklist a bunch of replies for DNS lookups [MCR]
* In order to avoid DNS errors causing more DNS lookups, only do new DNS
  lookups when there is a timeout --- other attempts will use additional
  addresses only [MCR]
* Have adns return getaddrinfo()-style EAI errors, even for old nquery work [MCR]

* Added additional debugging to delayed DNS lookup continuation [MCR]
* Init generic CR before filling in DNS name so that qtid gets logged sanely [MCR]
* Keep track of states that are created to potentially bring up a parent SA.
  This is needed to tell if there is an ongoing initiation for a delayed-DNS
  effort, or if one should be made. Do not make an attempt to bring up the
  conn unless the policy is set to UP.  Use returned state number from the
  initiate process to always get correct state in test harness [MCR]
* Make test validate that handle_adns_answer() does not cause conn to be set to UP [MCR]
* Make clean would clean up whackfile, so on reffile use, cp it to OUTPUT [MCR]

* Updates after rebase [MCR]
* Add test case lp33 for dns delayed, when there is no hint [MCR]
* For unclear reasons the lookup of cassidy.sandelman.ca/KEY RR fails. Could

* Create dummy kick_adns_connection [MCR]
* _pluto_adns is no longer a seperate program, but is part of the pluto
  executable, forked out for use. This makes it much easier for embedded

  switch to c-ares This patch also includes changing progname to a const
  globally [MCR]

*  Log eroute operations more concisely, do it after they succeed/fail [MCR]
*  Better logging of eroute_owner [MCR]

 * Change negotiated tunnel message to be clearer with IPv6 addresses [MCR]
 *  Using short notation, using GNUmakefile notdir, and making sure that $< will
    reference the right file by making explicit %.c->%.o rule. [Jason]
 *  Show the connection name when the state is found, provide a way to nicely dump a single state to debug log [MCR]
 *  Change find_host_pair so that it knows if it is creating a new host pair, as host pairs that have right=%any will always match [MCR]

 *  Cope with a NULL prompt_pass, make something up to store passphrase if necessary [MCR]
 *  Adopted some kernel_netkey.c fixes from libreswan, and added some debug of port numbers [MCR]
 *  Reset the remote port number to 0, as lack of client should indicate lack of port numbers (XXX maybe not) [MCR]
 *  rw_instantiate needs to take remote address from state [MCR]
 *  Simplify evaluation of when we need to instantiate templates: all conns that
    are templates should be instantiated [MCR]

 *  Log when there is no send_whack_msg function [MCR]
 *  Do not even try to use libnss for certain non-critical PEM related 3DES operations [MCR]
 *  Make sure that st_localaddr and st_localport is setup based upon where we observe traffic to flow
    this information is used when has_client=0, and we are really proposing a conn for self. [MCR]
 *  If end has no client, then set end to appropriate value from state [MCR]
 *  Correctly return no proposal chosen when the initiator suggests 0.0.0.0->0.0.0.0,
    which previously matched encoding for %any [MCR]

 *  Explain liboswkeys library [MCR]
 *  Explain libpluto [MCR]
 *  Make connection loading description a bit prettier [MCR]
 *  Module mis-named, got an i in front of af_key [MCR]

 *  Update IPSECBASEVERSION in Makefile.ver for packagingprep target (simon)
 *  Make ikeping diagnostics saner, and show help rather than aborting [MCR]
 *  Clarify that whack_magic mismatch has nothing to do with klips [MCR]

 * Mark some SPD/SA creation code as debug [MCR]
 * Remove extensive but useless satype processing from netlink_raw_eroute [MCR]
 * Added state to eroute_connection so that peer address can be taken from there [MCR]
 * Just because right=%any, does not mean that it is a template [MCR]
 * Simplify the kernel SA add code to use src/dst where appropriate, and src_client/dst_client properly [MCR]
 * Updated natt port handling to pull from parent_st. [MCR]
 * Found potentially dead code in update_ipsec_sa() [MCR]
 * Log src/dst after it is inbound/outbound set [MCR]
 * Take IPsec SA end points from state rather than from policy [MCR]
 * Pass parent state down in IPsec SA creation routines so that an accurate st_localaddr/st_remoteaddr is available.
      Note should also add port numbers --- IKEv2 NAT work is probably still open [MCR]
 * Some debug of setup_half_ipsec_sa [MCR]
 * SA src/dst is not a subnet, but an address, so use appropriate structure [MCR]
 * Log algorithm lookup in KLIPS debug, and also IP address pairs of endpoint [MCR]
 * When responding in an error condition, keep the state around awhile
   in case there is a retransmit; but eventually remove it [MCR]
 * Always collect other peers SPI value, we need it. With this change, the spi=0000000 problem goes away [MCR]
 * Moved detection that responder has sent multiple proposals outside of block that matches them [MCR]
 * Role can never change in ikev2parent_inR2, it is always the initiator [MCR]
 * Added progress debug to setup_half_ipsec_sa so errors from kernel make more sense [MCR]
 * Removed role parameter from emit_ts, and move next_payload calculation to parent [MCR]
 * Removed note about duplicate_state --- state duplication occurs in ike_child_sa_respond [MCR]
 * Defend ikev2_encrypt_msg against possible bad inputs; might come from ikev2_delete_out [MCR]
 * Make code associated with being a responder not optional [MCR]
 * Removed role parameter from ike_child_sa_respond, as it never is called by initiator [MCR]

 * Do not log NAT port changes if original address is 0.0.0.0 [MCR]
 * Import libreswan (2bc8abe3) netlink fixes [MCR]
 * Make sigusr1 handler static [MCR]
 * Added DEBUG_WITH_PAUSE to keep pluto from running away with retransmits
   when developer is thinking after a failure [MCR]
 * Adopt a bunch of IKE algorithm definitions, and attempt to
    find and quiet source of duplicate algorithm entries [MCR]
 * Refactor ESP creation into new function for readability [MCR]
 * Pluto now accepts SIGUSR1: this presently does nothing (crypto subprocesses ignore it)
    it can be used with DEBUG_WITH_PAUSE to "single step" pluto interactions which are going
    too fast to figure manually inspect.
    In particular, one can do "ipsec whack --status" on the peer before letting the processing
    proceed. [MCR]
 * Note in logs when parentSA is considered good [MCR]
 * Disentangle LIBNSS and non-LIBNSS code [MCR]
 * Convert some uses of whack_log to loglog() so that they go into system log too! [MCR]
 * Log the IKE version in state, and if v2-parent, log the msgid counters [MCR]
 * State_hash now returns the bucket number, which can aid in certain kinds of debugging [MCR]
 * Some minor comments about msgid processing
    make sure that if the msgid is too large or cookies do not match, that no further processing occurs [MCR]
 * Gave all the IKEv2 state microcodes a human readable name [MCR]
 * Found problems with mis-initialized st_msgid_nextuse, created new routing to allocate them from parent [MCR]
 * Added record of IKE maj/min version to state structure.
    Collect it in into the msgdigest, and insert into stats on receive/create-state, and initialize
    it when initiating. [MCR]
 * Found error in starter_whack_add_pubkey that resulted in public keys not loaded. This was
    introduced in commit: 0783e455 by mcr (me!) [MCR]
 * Improve documentation of starter_whack_build_pkmsg [MCR]
 * Set LOOSE_ENUM_OTHER values appropriate, and debug the result if desired [MCR]
 * Parser_loose_enum used to return explicit "255", which matches LOOSE_ENUM_OTHER
    as a value. But instead put the appropriate value into the keyword_def structure.
 * Not only is this more flexible, but it is much easier to understand [MCR]
 * Mark keyword_name() arg0 as const [MCR]
 * Adjust ikev1 for new find_host_connection ANY that takes histype [MCR]
 * Added KH_IPADDR to list of host type keywords [MCR]
 * Added histype to find_connection functions [MCR]
 * Some initial changes to put %any processing into host_pair code [MCR]
 * Log host type of remote side of conn in host_pair [MCR]
 * Changes to link order cause liboswlog to be properly linked in; this requires exit_tool
    and progname to be setup properly [MCR]
 * Import TS checking/narrowing code from libreswan into ikev2parent_inR2 [MCR]
 * Changed SEND_NOTIFICATION to SEND_V2_NOTIFICATION, from libreswan [MCR]
 * Ikev2_log_parentSA should be used on initiator and responder.
    It is a good candidate for a function that could be omitted when memory is tight [MCR]
 * Ikev2_process_payloads is wrong for processing and encrypted payload, do it inline [MCR]
 * Make sure that event is always deleted on free_state [MCR]
 * Added counter for number of retransmissions from responder seen [MCR]
 * Repeated payload problem fixed [MCR]
 * Notification should go to whack log, with appropriate value
    make sure to set the current state, and remove debugging of payloads seen [MCR]
 * Create a way to run parentI1 with calculations so that they can be saved (does not work yet) [MCR]
 * Always include RFC5144 groups, no more ifdef [MCR]
 * Split libnss code from non-libnss for better clarity [MCR]
    outR1 could well assign the header msgID from the initiator's messageID,
    but since the I1 messageID is defined to be zero, it should all be the same.
    The messageID is sequence in IKEv2, but in IKEv1, it's opaque, so handle htonl() here. [MCR]
 * Processing of v2N_INVALID_KE_PAYLOAD notify [MCR]
 * Now picks correct state when notify is seen [MCR]
 * ikeI1 state to deal with respondering sending a notify [MCR]
 * Add target to make assembly for examining underlying causes [MCR]
 * Do not delete state immediately, mark it as waiting to delete [MCR]
 * Permit the RHEL7 spec file to also build on RHEL6.5. xmlto otherwise can not resolve dependancy
    for lynx vs elinks. RHEL7 does not seem to have lynx [MCR]
 * Change log of state deletion to not be a debug, log state name too (idea from libreswan) [MCR]
 * Move spd formatting routines to library [MCR]
 * Split orient() function into new file so it can be tested [MCR]
 * When processing conf files, a missing right=/left= should cause an error and the conn should not be loaded [MCR]
 * Move orient function to libpluto.
    Pass it the pluto_port number to use, rather than reference a global [MCR]
 * Change pluto_port -> pluto_port500,
    introduce pluto_port4500. Make setting the pluto_port also set the NAT traversal port to +4000 of it.
    Do not hard code the port 4500, use IETF name for port 4500 [MCR]
 * New function: ikev2parent_outI1_withstate permits IKEv2 to start with some state [MCR]
 * Refactor pubkey addition process, add this to whack write [MCR]
 * Include option to create whack files from loaded conns [MCR]
 * Refactor serialization of whack message to reuse in readwriteconf [MCR]
 * Return count of messages read so that failures can more easily be diagnosed [MCR]
 * Move whack msg write functions to libpluto [MCR]
 * Make sure that the --secctx_attr_value is always accepted, and if appropriate, ignored [MCR]
 * Permit an explicit nhelpers=-1 [MCR]
 * Added family2str to decode AF_INET/AF_INET6 nicely [MCR]
 * Moved defs.h to include/pluto/defs.h, so change the include slightly [MCR]
 * Change some more variables to LIBFOO from FOOLIB [MCR]
 * A batch of libreswan configuration code was ported as it was noticed that there was some
    mix of strdup/clone_str already.
    Some keywords were imported, many were not yet imported.  The code is formatted vastly differently [MCR]
 * Refactor key building whack message processing [MCR]

 *  Ubuntu has backported some code to 3.13, so use correct select code [MCR]
 *  KLIPS patches for kernel 3.18 [MCR]
 *  Use a more KLIPS-y way to detect if KLIPS is loaded; not ancient pfkey interface [MCR]
 *  While the uid  and pid types changes for namespace support since 3.12,
    rather than fix that, KLIPS really does not need to know the PID at all. [MCR]
 *  Compile out the pfkey /proc interfaces; they provide no value [MCR]
 *  Use IP_SELECT_IDENT_NEW for kernel 3.12 series [MCR]
 *  Replace the ipsec_proc interface with seq based interfaces [MCR]

 This version specifically addresses CVE 2013-6466.

 Big changes are coming for the testing subsystem.
   From this version on, we are disengaging the testing subsystem from
   the Openswan source tree.  You can still get a copy at
   git@github.com:xelerance/old-openswan-testing.git

 Some parts of an RFC4306/5996 patch were removed due to it
 introducing a few IKEv2 specific crashers.

   introduced startnetkey functions.
   UML kernel configuration canonicalization updated.

v2.5.13 (May 7, 2007)
   move DNS lookups from libipsecconf into pluto, where they belong. DNS lookups
	are still only done once during conn load time, and are done synchronously.

v2.5.12 (Apr 30, 2007)
   A fix to detect that XEN has been patched into the kernel, and set
   some of the 2.6.18 changes.
   never log starter_log() things to stdout, they always go to stderr.
   when a packet is passed through, do not call NF_IP_LOCAL_OUT, as it has already
	passed through the output hooks, and doing it again, confuses things
	causing ip_route_me_harder() which creates a look, since it does the flow
	lookup again. (This doesn't happen if the kernel hasn't got XFRM support)
   fixed parsing of config file so that "version 2" is accepted.
   fixed addconn to respect "right/left"sourceip=, new test case sourceip-01
   fixed processing of "first"/"last" packet for %trap/%hold conns in KLIPS, it now
	properly forwards the packets when the packet is released.


v2.5.11 (Apr 19, 2007)
   Some fixes in KLIPS for "ipsec eroute --clear" bug. It is not clear
   why this suddendly became an issue, or if it would have been an issue
   previously, given the right compiler optimization.

v2.5.10 (Apr 2, 2007)
   Includes fixes for xmlto generation for _confread directory.

v2.5.09 (Apr 2, 2007)
   Minor fix to build process, updated CHANGES file.

v2.5.08 (Apr 2, 2007)
   Correct release.
   Includes some changes to permit OE to work without nexthop,
   however this seems to cause it to return an unreachable on
   the first message.

v2.5.07	-dud due to release script error.

v2.5.06 (?)
   set LANGUAGE, LANG and LC_ALL in setup script.
   change OE off by default note and scripts.
   Merge of additional code from 2.4.

v2.5.05 (Feb 14, 2007)
   2.5.03 and 2.5.04 were not properly released, and 2.5.05 now
   is properly released and includes below items

v2.5.04 (?)
    zero peer_ca to avoid crashes.
    (include glob's may still not work correctly)

v2.5.0sbs5 (Dec 12, 2005)
    fixed issues with libwhack not getting built with VIRTUAL_IP.
    adjusted programs/pluto/Makefile to depend upon libraries better

v2.5.0sbs4 (Dec 11, 2005)
    When a template conn is instantiated for a phase 1 configuration, it
	may still need to be adjusted to a virtual IP address. In addition,
	change the order of the virtual IP address setting and the
	port-wildcard processing.
        This patch also provides some additional debugging of the proposal
	which actually processed by the machinery.

    tests for L2TP+X.509 L2TP configuration --- 2 clients behind the
        same NAT with certificates that need to have their connection both
        instantiated (in phase 1) and virtualized (in phase 2).

v2.5.03 (Jan 10, 2007)

    ipsec.conf parsing should ignore keywords that start with x-
	they are a form of structured comment.
    added in forceencaps= keyword.
    process wildcards with glob() in include statements.

v2.5.02 (?)
    fixed bug in ipsec.conf parser, where it could not read values
       that had = in them (such as base64 encoded keys)
    fixed bug in key continuation code that could cause a crash
	if the DNS request timed out after the state was deleted
	for other reasons.

v2.5.01 (Jan 2, 2007)
    merged xauthusername code base + multinet tests in.
    removed /dev/hw_random from list of valid random sources on linux.
        use "rngd" instead to feed /dev/random.

v2.5.00 (Nov 2, 2006)
    fixed various bugs with lifetime values in ipsec.conf parser
    AES-128 (group 5, MD5 or SHA1 for PRF) is now accepted for phase 1,
	and it is now the preferred cipher as well. This should be the
	case for Main mode, Aggressive mode, and for XAUTH client and
	XAUTH server, and PSK and RSA sig mode.

    fixes so that starter will now compile
    move whacklib to lib/libwhack
    adjust makefiles to work with OBJDIR version of Makefile.program
    switch to OBJDIR in programs/* and lib/* if it is defined

    added sanitizer for PID files
    be smarter about including git version info into version
    We need to use /dev/urandom first, as it has more random than /dev/random.
       Otherwise, we run out really fast (within a few minutes)
    Use endian.h when comiling out-of-kernel
    patch to turn error about 17/500,0/0 vs 17/0 error with Cisco VPN3000
       into a warning.
    remove test for NAT-T VID vs NATD payload test. It fails for reasons
       that are unknown at this time, and this check is really being pedantic.
    MAJOR: use starter code for "addconn"
    MAJOR: always use OBJDIRs, and compile on Windows (no kernel)
    MAJOR: includes "Taproom" code --- TCL call outs from pluto at IKE
		transition states.
