// designed by Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen. This version is designed
// to provide both fixed and dynamic block and key lengths and can also
// run with either big or little endian internal byte order (see aes.h).
// It inputs block and key lengths in bytes with the legal values being
// 16, 24 and 32.
