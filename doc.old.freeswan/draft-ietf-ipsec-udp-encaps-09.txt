Abstract

   This protocol specification defines methods to encapsulate and
   decapsulate IP Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) packets inside
   UDP packets for the purpose of traversing Network Address
   Translators. ESP encapsulation as defined in this document is capable
   of being used in both IPv4 and IPv6 scenarios. The encapsulation is
   used whenever negotiated using Internet Key Exchange (IKE).

Internet-Draft    UDP Encapsulation of IPsec ESP Packets        May 2004


1.  Introduction

   This protocol specification defines methods to encapsulate and
   decapsulate ESP packets inside UDP packets for the purpose of
   traversing NATs (see [RFC 3715] section 2.2, case i). The UDP port
   numbers are the same as used by IKE traffic, as defined in
   [NAT-T-IKE].

   The sharing of the port numbers for both IKE and UDP encapsulated ESP
   traffic was selected because it offers better scaling (only one NAT
   mapping in the NAT, no need to send separate IKE keepalives), easier
   configuration (only one port to be configured in firewalls), and
   easier implementation.

   It is up to the need of the clients whether transport mode or tunnel
   mode is to be supported (see [RFC 3715] Section 3 criteria
   "Telecommuter scenario"). L2TP/IPsec clients MUST support the modes
   as defined in [RFC 3193]. IPsec tunnel mode clients MUST support
   tunnel mode.

   An IKE implementation supporting this protocol specification MUST NOT
   use the ESP SPI field zero for ESP packets. This ensures that IKE
   packets and ESP packets can be distinguished from each other.

   UDP encapsulation of ESP packets as defined in this document is
   written in terms of IPv4 headers. There is no technical reason why an
   IPv6 header could not be used as the outer header and/or as the inner
   header.

   Because the protection of the outer IP addresses in IPsec AH is
   inheritly incompatible with NAT, the IPsec AH was left out of the
   scope of this protocol specification. This protocol also assumes that
   IKE (IKEv1 [RFC2401] or IKEv2 [IKEv2]) is used to negotiate the IPsec
   SAs, manual keying is not supported.

3.  Encapsulation and Decapsulation Procedures

3.1  Auxiliary Procedures

3.1.1  Tunnel Mode Decapsulation NAT Procedure

   When a tunnel mode has been used to transmit packets (see [RFC 3715]
   Section 3 criteria "Mode support" and "Telecommuter scenario"), the
   inner IP header can contain addresses that are not suitable for the
   current network. This procedure defines how these addresses are to be
   converted to suitable addresses for the current network.

   Depending on local policy, one of the following MUST be done:
   1.  If a valid source IP address space has been defined in the policy
       for the encapsulated packets from the peer, check that the source
       IP address of the inner packet is valid according to the policy.
   2.  If an address has been assigned for the remote peer, check that
       the source IP address used in the inner packet is the same as the
       IP address assigned.
   3.  NAT is performed for the packet, making it suitable for transport
       in the local network.

3.1.2  Transport Mode Decapsulation NAT Procedure

   When a transport mode has been used to transmit packets, contained
   TCP or UDP headers will contain incorrect checksums due to the change
   of parts of the IP header during transit. This procedure defines how
   to fix these checksums (see [RFC 3715] Section 2.1, case b).

   Depending on local policy, one of the following MUST be done:
   1.  If the protocol header after the ESP header is a TCP/UDP header
       and the peer's real source and destination IP address have been
       received according to [NAT-T-IKE], incrementally recompute the
       TCP/UDP checksum:
       *  subtract the IP source address in the received packet from the
          checksum
       *  add the real IP source address received via IKE to the
          checksum (obtained from the NAT-OA)
       *  subtract the IP destination address in the received packet
          from the checksum
       *  add the real IP destination address received via IKE to the
          checksum (obtained from the NAT-OA)
       Note: if received and real address are the same for a given
       address, say the source address, the operations cancel and don't
       need to be performed.
   2.  If the protocol header after the ESP header is a TCP/UDP header,
       recompute the checksum field in the TCP/UDP header.

Internet-Draft    UDP Encapsulation of IPsec ESP Packets        May 2004


   3.  If the protocol header after the ESP header is an UDP header,
       zero the checksum field in the UDP header. If the protocol header
       after the ESP header is a TCP header, and there is an option to
       flag to the stack that TCP checksum does not need to be computed,
       then that flag MAY be used.  This SHOULD only be done for
       transport mode, and if the packet is integrity protected.  Tunnel
       mode TCP checksums MUST be verified. [This is not a violation to
       the spirit of section 4.2.2.7 in RFC 1122 because a checksum is
       being generated by the sender, and verified by the receiver.
       That checksum is the integrity over the packet performed by
       IPsec.]

   In addition an implementation MAY fix any contained protocols that
   have been broken by NAT (see [RFC 3715] Section 2.1 case g).

4.  NAT Keepalive Procedure

   The sole purpose of sending NAT-keepalive packets is to keep NAT
   mappings alive for the duration of a connection between the peers
   (see [RFC 3715] Section 2.2 case j). Reception of NAT-keepalive
   packets MUST NOT be used to detect liveness of a connection.

   A peer MAY send a NAT-keepalive packet if there exists one or more
   phase I or phase II SAs between the peers, or such an SA has existed
   at most N minutes earlier. N is a locally configurable parameter with
   a default value of 5 minutes.

   A peer SHOULD send a NAT-keepalive packet if a need to send such
   packets is detected according to [NAT-T-IKE] and if no other packet
   to the peer has been sent in M seconds. M is a locally configurable
   parameter with a default value of 20 seconds.

5.  Security Considerations

5.1  Tunnel Mode Conflict

   Implementors are warned that it is possible for remote peers to
   negotiate entries that overlap in a SGW (security gateway), an issue
   affecting tunnel mode (see [RFC 3715] Section 2.1 case e).

            10.1.2.3

   Because SGW will now see two possible SAs that lead to 10.1.2.3, it
   can become confused where to send packets coming from Suzy's server.
   Implementators MUST devise ways of preventing such a thing from
   occurring.

   It is RECOMMENDED that SGW either assign locally unique IP addresses
   to Ari's and Bob's Laptop using a protocol such as DHCP over IPsec,
   or uses NAT to change Ari's and Bob's Laptop source IP addresses to
   such locally unique addresses before sending packets forward to
   Suzy's Server (this covers "Scaling" criteria of section 3 in [RFC
   3715]).

5.2  Transport Mode Conflict

   Another similar issue may occur in transport mode, with 2 clients,
   Ari and Bob, behind the same NAT talking securely to the same server
   (see [RFC 3715] Section 2.1 case e).

   Cliff wants to talk in the clear to the same server.

            Cliff's
            Laptop
           10.1.2.5

   Now, transport SAs on the server will look like:

   To Ari: Server to NAT, <traffic desc1>, UDP encap <4500, Y>

   To Bob: Server to NAT, <traffic desc2>, UDP encap <4500, Z>

   Cliff's traffic is in the clear, so there is no SA.

   <traffic desc> is the protocol and port information. The UDP encap
   ports are the ports used in UDP encapsulated ESP format of Section
   2.1. Y,Z are the dynamic ports assigned by the NAT during the IKE
   negotiation. So IKE traffic from Ari's laptop goes out on UDP
   <4500,4500>. It reaches the server as UDP <Y,4500>, where Y is the
   dynamically assigned port.

   If the <traffic desc1> overlaps <traffic desc2>, then simple filter
   lookups may not be sufficient to determine which SA needs to be used
   to send traffic. Implementations MUST handle this situation, either
   by disallowing conflicting connections, or by other means.

   Assume now that Cliff wants to connect to the server in the clear.
   This is going to be difficult to configure since the server already
   has a policy from Server to the NAT's external address, for securing
   <traffic desc>. For totally non-overlapping traffic descriptions,
   this is possible.

   Sample server policy could be:

Internet-Draft    UDP Encapsulation of IPsec ESP Packets        May 2004


   To Ari: Server to NAT, All UDP, secure

   To Bob: Server to NAT, All TCP, secure

   To Cliff: Server to NAT, ALL ICMP, clear text

   Note, this policy also lets Ari and Bob send cleartext ICMP to the
   server.

   The server sees all clients behind the NAT as the same IP address, so
   setting up different policies for the same traffic descriptor is in
   principle impossible.

   A problematic example configuration on the server is:

   Server to NAT, TCP, secure (for Ari and Bob)

   Server to NAT, TCP, clear  (for Cliff)

   The problem is that the server cannot enforce his policy, since it is
   possible that misbehaving Bob sends traffic in the clear. This is
   indistinguishable from Cliff sending traffic in the clear. So it is
   impossible to guarantee security from some clients behind a NAT, and
   also allow clear text from different clients behind the SAME NAT. If
   the server's security policy allows, however, it can do best effort
   security: if the client from behind the NAT initiates security, his
   connection will be secured. If he sends in the clear, the server will
   still accept that clear text.

   So, for security guarantees, the above problematic scenario MUST NOT
   be allowed on servers. For best effort security, this scenario MAY be
   used.

Appendix A.  Clarification of potential NAT multiple client solutions

   This appendix provides clarification about potential solutions to the
   problem of multiple clients behind the same NAT simultaneously
   connecting to the same destination IP address.

   Section 5.1 and Section 5.2 say that you MUST avoid this problem. As
   this isn't a wire protocol matter, but a local implementation matter,
   specification of the mechanisms do not belong in the protocol
   specification itself. They are instead listed in this appendix.

   Choosing an option will likely depend on the scenarios for which you
   use/support IPsec NAT-T. This list is not meant to be exhaustive, so
   other solutions may exist. We first describe the generic choices that
   solve the problem for all upper layer protocols.

   Generic choices for ESP transport mode:

   Tr1) Implement a built-in NAT (network address translation) above
   IPsec decapsulation.

   Tr2) Implement a built-in NAPT (network address port translation)
   above IPsec decapsulation.

   Tr3) An initiator may decide not to request transport mode once NAT
   is detected and instead request a tunnel mode SA. This may be a retry
   after transport mode is denied by the responder, or it may be the
   initiator's choice to propose a tunnel SA initially. This is no more
   difficult than knowing whether to propose transport mode or tunnel
   mode without NAT. If for some reason the responder prefers or
   requires tunnel mode for NAT traversal, it must reject the quick mode
   SA proposal for transport mode.

   Generic choises for ESP tunnel mode:

   Tn1) Same as Tr1.

   Tn2) Same as Tr2.

   Tn3) This option is possible if an initiator is capable of being
   assigned an address through it's tunnel SA with the responder using
   DHCP. The initiator may initially request an internal address via the
   DHCP-IPsec method, regardless of whether it knows it is behind a NAT.
   Or it may re-initiate an IKE quick mode negotiation for DHCP tunnel
   SA after the responder fails the quick mode SA transport mode
   proposal, either when NAT-OA payload is sent or because it discovers
   from NAT-D the initiator is behind a NAT and it's local
   configuration/policy will only accept connecting through NAT when

   being assigned an address through DHCP-IPsec.

   There are also implementation choices offereing limited
   interoperability. Implementors should specify what applications or
   protocols should work using their NAT-T solution if these options are
   selected. Note that neither Tr4 nor Tn4, as described below, are
   expected to work with TCP traffic.

   Limited interoperability choices for ESP transport mode:

   Tr4) Implement upper layer protocol awareness of the inbound &
   outbound IPsec SA so that it doesn't use the source IP and the source
   port as the session identifier. (E.g. L2TP session ID mapped to the
   IPsec SA pair which doesn't use the UDP source port or the source IP
   address for peer uniqueness.)

   Tr5) Implement application integration with IKE initiation such that
   it can rebind to a different source port if the IKE quick mode SA
   proposal is rejected by the responder, then repropose the new QM
   selector.

   Limited interoperability choices for ESP tunnel mode:

   Tn4) Same as Tr4.
