Basic pluto X.509 test, with send_cr.

East does *NOT* have West's X.509 Cert locally.
west is FORCED to send it.

In this case, the certificate is placed into DER format, and is loaded into
pluto using leftcertype=0x01, and leftcert=/file

This tests the "cert is blob" code.

Otherwise, identical to x509-pluto-03.
