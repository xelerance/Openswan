This test has a road warrior, ("road") connecting to VPN host east.

It shows up from a random IP.

It uses PSK to authenticate for phase 1.
It uses aggressive mode.
It then uses XAUTH to authenticate the phase 1.5.
It then uses MODECFG to configure the phase 2, in server push mode.
It then sends DNS and WINS servers using modecfgdns1,modecfgdn2,modecfgwins1
and modecfgwins2.

NOTE: Some clients require that for these messages IV from phase2, not phase1
is used. We need to turn that into an option.

It then proceeds to phase 2.
