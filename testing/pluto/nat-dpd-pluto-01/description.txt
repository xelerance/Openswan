This is a test of NAT-traversal, with DPD enabled.

The network is configured as follows:

    POLE
      |
    NORTH
      |
      NIC---EAST--SUNRISE

A NAT is setup on NIC that does traditional NAPT on the
NORTH network. 

The simple test is to connect the POLE and SUNRISE networks
together. This is tested with a ping, a la "basic-pluto-03"

This is a copy of nat-pluto-01, except it has DPD enabled.
