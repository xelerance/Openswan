Complex test of Transport mode through a NAT.

This is like nat-transport-02, but we arrange to have *TWO* clients behind
the NAT.

A single transport mode SA is created between north and east, for port 3.

On north, firewalling makes sure that one can only access port 3 via IPsec.
Similiarly for the "road" machine.
