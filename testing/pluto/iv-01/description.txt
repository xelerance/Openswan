This is a variation of basic-pluto-01.

The impairement "jacob-two-two" is used.

This causes *TWO* things (which are not related, but at the moment, I
don't think many people want to test things seperately).

a)    it causes a sender to send every packet twice.
	 ("Jacob Two Two is two, plus two, plus two. He has two older
	 brothers and two older sisters and he says everything twice, because
	 no one ever listens to him the first time.
	    ..."

	   A book/record (vinyl) that I enjoyed greatly as a kid)

b)    it causes could_eroute() to always return FALSE, causing SAs
      to fail to be installed.

This test is for dealing with the issue of the new_iv_len not being
set, and encrypt_message() failing with a passert() if the sender
retransmits.

It sets nhelpers=0, because it makes it crash more predictably.
