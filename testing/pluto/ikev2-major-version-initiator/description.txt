Basic pluto with IKEv2 on the initiator (west), and on the responder.

This test enables --impair-major-version-bump that will send a higher
major version number on the initiator. The connection should fail .

See: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5996#section-2.5

   If an endpoint receives a message with a higher major version number,
   it MUST drop the message and SHOULD send an unauthenticated Notify
   message of type INVALID_MAJOR_VERSION containing the highest
   (closest) version number it supports.  If an endpoint supports major
   version n, and major version m, it MUST support all versions between
   n and m.  If it receives a message with a major version that it
   supports, it MUST respond with that version number.  In order to
   prevent two nodes from being tricked into corresponding with a lower
   major version number than the maximum that they both support, IKE has
   a flag that indicates that the node is capable of speaking a higher
   major version number.

   Thus, the major version number in the IKE header indicates the
   version number of the message, not the highest version number that
   the transmitter supports.  If the initiator is capable of speaking
   versions n, n+1, and n+2, and the responder is capable of speaking
   versions n and n+1, then they will negotiate speaking n+1, where the
   initiator will set a flag indicating its ability to speak a higher
   version.  If they mistakenly (perhaps through an active attacker
   sending error messages) negotiate to version n, then both will notice
   that the other side can support a higher version number, and they
   MUST break the connection and reconnect using version n+1.

biddown attacks, see testcase ikev2-07-biddown
