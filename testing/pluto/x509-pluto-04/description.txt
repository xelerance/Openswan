The network is configured as follows:

    POLE
      |
    NORTH
      |
      NIC---EAST--SUNRISE

East does not have north's certificate cached. East will send a null
CR to north, which means to send all of its certificates.

North will transmit its certificate to east via nic. North's certificate 
is issued by a CA east accepts (cacerts/caCert.pem), and so should be
accepted.

NIC serves as a simple router between NORTH and EAST.

The simple test is to connect the POLE and SUNRISE networks
together. This is tested with a ping, a la "basic-pluto-03"
