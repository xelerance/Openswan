# use this script to run some script on each reference output script.
# It uses the foreach_ref_console function in functions.sh to do its
# work.
#
# Start this from testing/*, listing all the test names (directories),
# space-separated. The script to run is the first argument.
#
# The script will be provided with three arguments -
#    1) the name of the test
#    2) the name of the console# which is either "", east or west
#    3) and the file where the reference console should be placed.
#
# The current working directory is *NOT* changed before the script is ran.
