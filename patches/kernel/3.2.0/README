The upstream kernel commit 0c9f79be295c99ac7e4b569ca493d75fdcc19e4e introduced a change in
net/ipv4/ip_sockglue.c requiring a slight modification of the SAref patches. This upstream
commit is being backported to stable kernels and have been applied at least to 3.0.56 and
3.2.35. The upstream kernel 3.2.35 is included in the Ubuntu kernel version 3.2.0-36.56.
