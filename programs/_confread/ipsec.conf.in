config setup
	# Do not set debug options to debug configuration issues!
	# plutodebug / klipsdebug = "all", "none" or a combination from below:
	# "raw crypt parsing emitting control klips pfkey natt x509 dpd private"
	# eg:
	# plutodebug="control parsing"
	# Again: only enable plutodebug or klipsdebug when asked by a developer
	#
	# enable to get logs per-peer
	# plutoopts="--perpeerlog"
	#
	# Enable core dumps (might require system changes, like ulimit -C)
	# This is required for abrtd to work properly
	# Note: incorrect SElinux policies might prevent pluto writing the core
