# This file defines the set of CIDRs (network/mask-length) to which
# communication should be private, if possible, but in the clear otherwise.
#
# If the target has a TXT (later IPSECKEY) record that specifies
# authentication material, we will require private (i.e. encrypted)
# communications.  If no such record is found, communications will be
# in the clear.
#
# See @FINALDOCDIR@/policygroups.html for details.
