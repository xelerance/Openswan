<para>A
<emphasis remap='B'>conn</emphasis>
section contains a
<emphasis remap='I'>connection specification</emphasis>,
defining a network connection to be made using IPsec.
The name given is arbitrary, and is used to identify the connection to
<citerefentry><refentrytitle>ipsec_auto</refentrytitle><manvolnum>8</manvolnum></citerefentry>
and
<citerefentry><refentrytitle>ipsec_manual</refentrytitle><manvolnum>8</manvolnum></citerefentry>.
Here's a simple example:</para>

<!-- .ne 10 -->
<literallayout remap='.nf'>
<!-- .ta 1c -->
<emphasis remap='B'>
conn snt
	left=10.11.11.1
	leftsubnet=10.0.1.0/24
	leftnexthop=172.16.55.66
	right=192.168.22.1
	rightsubnet=10.0.2.0/24
	rightnexthop=172.16.88.99
	keyingtries=%forever
</emphasis>
</literallayout> <!-- .fi -->

<para>A note on terminology...
In automatic keying, there are two kinds of communications going on:
transmission of user IP packets, and gateway-to-gateway negotiations for
keying, rekeying, and general control.
The data path (a set of &ldquo;IPsec SAs&rdquo;) used for user packets is herein
referred to as the &ldquo;connection&rdquo;;
the path used for negotiations (built with &ldquo;ISAKMP SAs&rdquo;) is referred to as
the &ldquo;keying channel&rdquo;.</para>

<para>To avoid trivial editing of the configuration file to suit it to each system
involved in a connection,
connection specifications are written in terms of
<emphasis remap='I'>left</emphasis>
and
<emphasis remap='I'>right</emphasis>
participants,
rather than in terms of local and remote.
Which participant is considered
<emphasis remap='I'>left</emphasis>
or
<emphasis remap='I'>right</emphasis>
is arbitrary;
IPsec figures out which one it is being run on based on internal information.
This permits using identical connection specifications on both ends.
There are cases where there is no symmetry; a good convention is to
use
<emphasis remap='I'>left</emphasis>
for the local side and
<emphasis remap='I'>right</emphasis>
for the remote side (the first letters are a good mnemonic).</para>

<para>Many of the parameters relate to one participant or the other;
only the ones for
<emphasis remap='I'>left</emphasis>
are listed here, but every parameter whose name begins with
<emphasis remap='B'>left</emphasis>
has a
<emphasis remap='B'>right</emphasis>
counterpart,
whose description is the same but with
<emphasis remap='B'>left</emphasis>
and
<emphasis remap='B'>right</emphasis>
reversed.</para>

<para>Parameters are optional unless marked &ldquo;(required)&rdquo;;
a parameter required for manual keying need not be included for
a connection which will use only automatic keying, and vice versa.</para>
