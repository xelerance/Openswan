<para>IKEv2 (RFC4309) settings to be used. Currently the accepted values
are
<emphasis remap='B'>never</emphasis>
(the default)
signifying no IKEv2 negotiation should be transmitted or accepted;
<emphasis remap='B'>permit</emphasis>,
signifying no IKEv2 should be transmitted, but will be accepted if the other
ends initiates to us with IKEv2;
<emphasis remap='B'>propose</emphasis>,
signifying that we permit IKEv2, and also use it as the default to initiate;
<emphasis remap='B'>insist</emphasis>,
signifying we only accept and receive IKEv2 - IKEv1 negotiations will be rejected.

If the ikev2= setting is set to <emphasis remap='B'>permit</emphasis>
or <emphasis remap='B'>propose</emphasis> Openswan will try and detect a
"bid down" attack from IKEv2 to IKEv1.  Since there is no standard for
transmitting the IKEv2 capability with IKEv1, Openswan uses a special
Vendor ID "CAN-IKEv2", and will insist on an IKEv2 rekey when it completes
an IKEv1 negotiation. If the ikev2= setting is set to
<emphasis remap='B'>insist</emphasis>, no IKEv1 negotiation is allowed,
and no bid down attack is possible.
