<para>IKE encryption/authentication algorithm to be used
for the connection (phase 1 aka ISAKMP SA).  The format is
<emphasis remap='I'>"cipher-hash;modpgroup, cipher-hash;modpgroup, ..."</emphasis>
Any left out option will be filled in with all allowed default
options. Multiple proposals are separated by a comma. If an
<emphasis remap='B'>ike=</emphasis>
line is specified, no other received proposals will be accepted.
Formerly there was a distinction (by using a <emphasis remap='B'>"!"</emphasis> symbol) between
"strict mode" or not. That mode has been obsoleted. If an <emphasis remap='B'>ike=</emphasis> option is
specified, the mode is always strict, meaning no other received proposals will be accepted.
Some examples are
<emphasis remap='B'>ike=3des-sha1,aes-sha1</emphasis>,
<emphasis remap='B'>ike=aes</emphasis>,
<emphasis remap='B'>ike=aes128-md5;modp2048</emphasis>,
<emphasis remap='B'>ike=aes128-sha1;dh22</emphasis>,
<emphasis remap='B'>ike=3des-md5;modp1024,aes-sha1;modp1536</emphasis> or
<emphasis remap='B'>ike=modp1536</emphasis>.
The options must be suitable as a value of
<citerefentry><refentrytitle>ipsec_spi</refentrytitle><manvolnum>8</manvolnum></citerefentry>'s
<option>--ike</option> option. The default is to use IKE, and to allow all combinations of:
<literallayout remap='.nf'><emphasis remap='B'>
                cipher:                 3des or aes
                hash:                   sha1 or md5
                pfsgroup (DHgroup):     modp1024 or modp1536
</emphasis></literallayout></para>
<para>
If Openswan was compiled with extra INSECURE and BROKEN options, then the des (1des) and null cipher, as
well as modp768 are available. This turns your VPN into a joke. Do not enable these options.</para>
<para>If openswan was compiled with USE_MODP_RFC5114 support, then Diffie-Hellman
groups 22, 23 and 24 are also implemented as per RFC-5114. Instead of the modp
key syntax, use the "dh" keyword, for example <emphasis>ike=3des-sha1;dh23</emphasis>
