.SH "NAME"
ipsec.conf \- IPsec configuration and connections
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The optional
\fIipsec\&.conf\fR
file specifies most configuration and control information for the Openswan IPsec subsystem\&. (The major exception is secrets for authentication; see
\fBipsec.secrets\fR(5)\&.) Its contents are not security\-sensitive
\fIunless\fR
manual keying is being done for more than just testing, in which case the encryption/authentication keys in the descriptions for the manually\-keyed connections are very sensitive (and those connection descriptions are probably best kept in a separate file, via the include facility described below)\&.
.PP
The file is a text file, consisting of one or more
\fIsections\fR\&. White space followed by
\fB#\fR
followed by anything to the end of the line is a comment and is ignored, as are empty lines which are not within a section\&.
.PP
A line which contains
\fBinclude\fR
and a file name, separated by white space, is replaced by the contents of that file, preceded and followed by empty lines\&. If the file name is not a full pathname, it is considered to be relative to the directory containing the including file\&. Such inclusions can be nested\&. Only a single filename may be supplied, and it may not contain white space, but it may include shell wildcards (see
\fBsh\fR(1)); for example:
.PP
\fBinclude\fR
\fBipsec\&.*\&.conf\fR
.PP
The intention of the include facility is mostly to permit keeping information on connections, or sets of connections, separate from the main configuration file\&. This permits such connection descriptions to be changed, copied to the other security gateways involved, etc\&., without having to constantly extract them from the configuration file and then insert them back into it\&. Note also the
\fBalso\fR
and
\fBalsoflip\fR
parameters (described below) which permit splitting a single logical section (e\&.g\&. a connection description) into several actual sections\&.
.PP
The first significant line of the file must specify the version of this specification that it conforms to:
.PP
\fBversion 2\fR
.PP
A section begins with a line of the form:
.PP
\fItype\fR
\fIname\fR
.PP
where
\fItype\fR
indicates what type of section follows, and
\fIname\fR
is an arbitrary name which distinguishes the section from others of the same type\&. (Names must start with a letter and may contain only letters, digits, periods, underscores, and hyphens\&.) All subsequent non\-empty lines which begin with white space are part of the section; comments within a section must begin with white space too\&. There may be only one section of a given type with a given name\&.
.PP
Lines within the section are generally of the form
.PP
\ \&\ \&\ \&\ \&\ \&\fIparameter\fR\fB=\fR\fIvalue\fR
.PP
(note the mandatory preceding white space)\&. There can be white space on either side of the
\fB=\fR\&. Parameter names follow the same syntax as section names, and are specific to a section type\&. Unless otherwise explicitly specified, no parameter name may appear more than once in a section\&.
.PP
An empty
\fIvalue\fR
stands for the system default value (if any) of the parameter, i\&.e\&. it is roughly equivalent to omitting the parameter line entirely\&. A
\fIvalue\fR
may contain white space only if the entire
\fIvalue\fR
is enclosed in double quotes (\fB"\fR); a
\fIvalue\fR
cannot itself contain a double quote, nor may it be continued across more than one line\&.
.PP
Numeric values are specified to be either an \(lqinteger\(rq (a sequence of digits) or a \(lqdecimal number\(rq (sequence of digits optionally followed by `\&.\*(Aq and another sequence of digits)\&.
.PP
There is currently one parameter which is available in any type of section:
.PP
\fBalso\fR
.RS 4
the value is a section name; the parameters of that section are appended to this section, as if they had been written as part of it\&. The specified section must exist, must follow the current one, and must have the same section type\&. (Nesting is permitted, and there may be more than one
\fBalso\fR
in a single section, although it is forbidden to append the same section more than once\&.) This allows, for example, keeping the encryption keys for a connection in a separate file from the rest of the description, by using both an
\fBalso\fR
parameter and an
\fBinclude\fR
line\&. (Caution, see BUGS below for some restrictions\&.)
.RE
.PP
\fBalsoflip\fR
.RS 4
can be used in a
\fBconn\fR
section\&. It acts like an
\fBalso\fR
that flips the referenced section\*(Aqs entries left\-for\-right\&.
.RE
.PP
Parameter names beginning with
\fBx\-\fR
(or
\fBX\-\fR, or
\fBx_\fR, or
\fBX_\fR) are reserved for user extensions and will never be assigned meanings by IPsec\&. Parameters with such names must still observe the syntax rules (limits on characters used in the name; no white space in a non\-quoted value; no newlines or double quotes within the value)\&. All other as\-yet\-unused parameter names are reserved for future IPsec improvements\&.
.PP
A section with name
\fB%default\fR
specifies defaults for sections of the same type\&. For each parameter in it, any section of that type which does not have a parameter of the same name gets a copy of the one from the
\fB%default\fR
section\&. There may be multiple
\fB%default\fR
sections of a given type, but only one default may be supplied for any specific parameter name, and all
\fB%default\fR
sections of a given type must precede all non\-\fB%default\fR
sections of that type\&.
\fB%default\fR
sections may not contain
\fBalso\fR
or
\fBalsoflip\fR
parameters\&.
.PP
Currently there are two types of section: a
\fBconfig\fR
section specifies general configuration information for IPsec, while a
\fBconn\fR
section specifies an IPsec connection\&.
.SH "CONN SECTIONS"
.PP
A
\fBconn\fR
section contains a
\fIconnection specification\fR, defining a network connection to be made using IPsec\&. The name given is arbitrary, and is used to identify the connection to
\fBipsec_auto\fR(8)
and
\fBipsec_manual\fR(8)\&. Here\*(Aqs a simple example:
.sp
.if n \{\

.\}
.PP
A note on terminology\&.\&.\&. In automatic keying, there are two kinds of communications going on: transmission of user IP packets, and gateway\-to\-gateway negotiations for keying, rekeying, and general control\&. The data path (a set of \(lqIPsec SAs\(rq) used for user packets is herein referred to as the \(lqconnection\(rq; the path used for negotiations (built with \(lqISAKMP SAs\(rq) is referred to as the \(lqkeying channel\(rq\&.
.PP
To avoid trivial editing of the configuration file to suit it to each system involved in a connection, connection specifications are written in terms of
\fIleft\fR
and
\fIright\fR
participants, rather than in terms of local and remote\&. Which participant is considered
\fIleft\fR
or
\fIright\fR
is arbitrary; IPsec figures out which one it is being run on based on internal information\&. This permits using identical connection specifications on both ends\&. There are cases where there is no symmetry; a good convention is to use
\fIleft\fR
for the local side and
\fIright\fR
for the remote side (the first letters are a good mnemonic)\&.
.PP
Many of the parameters relate to one participant or the other; only the ones for
\fIleft\fR
are listed here, but every parameter whose name begins with
\fBleft\fR
has a
\fBright\fR
counterpart, whose description is the same but with
\fBleft\fR
and
\fBright\fR
reversed\&.
.PP
Parameters are optional unless marked \(lq(required)\(rq; a parameter required for manual keying need not be included for a connection which will use only automatic keying, and vice versa\&.
.SS "CONN PARAMETERS: GENERAL"
.PP
The following parameters are relevant to both automatic and manual keying\&. Unless otherwise noted, for a connection to work, in general it is necessary for the two ends to agree exactly on the values of these parameters\&.
.PP
\fBconnaddrfamily\fR
.RS 4
the connection addrress family of the connection; currently the accepted values are
\fBipv4\fR
(the default); or
\fBipv6\fR\&. This option is confusing, especially when doing IPv4\-in\-IPv6 or IPv6\-in\-IPv4 tunnels\&. The developers hope to remove this option in the near future for proper auto\-detection\&. For now, set connaddrfamily= to the family of the *subnet= options, and if those are not defined, to the family of the left=/right= options\&.
.sp
IPv6 is supported with NETKEY since openswan 2\&.4 and with KLIPS since Openswan 2\&.6\&.33
.RE
.PP
\fBtype\fR
.RS 4
the type of the connection; currently the accepted values are
\fBtunnel\fR
(the default) signifying a host\-to\-host, host\-to\-subnet, or subnet\-to\-subnet tunnel;
\fBtransport\fR, signifying host\-to\-host transport mode;
\fBpassthrough\fR, signifying that no IPsec processing should be done at all;
\fBdrop\fR, signifying that packets should be discarded; and
\fBreject\fR, signifying that packets should be discarded and a diagnostic ICMP returned\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBleft\fR
.RS 4
(required) the IP address of the left participant\*(Aqs public\-network interface, in any form accepted by
\fBipsec_ttoaddr\fR(3)\&. Currently, IPv4 and IPv6 IP addresses are supported\&. There are several magic values\&. If it is
\fB%defaultroute\fR, and the
\fBconfig\fR
\fBsetup\fR
section\*(Aqs,
\fBinterfaces\fR
specification contains
\fB%defaultroute,\fR
\fBleft\fR
will be filled in automatically with the local address of the default\-route interface (as determined at IPsec startup time); this also overrides any value supplied for
\fBleftnexthop\fR\&. (Either
\fBleft\fR
or
\fBright\fR
may be
\fB%defaultroute\fR, but not both\&.) The value
\fB%any\fR
signifies an address to be filled in (by automatic keying) during negotiation\&. The value
\fB%opportunistic\fR
signifies that both
\fBleft\fR
and
\fBleftnexthop\fR
are to be filled in (by automatic keying) from DNS data for
\fBleft\fR\*(Aqs client\&.
The values
\fB%group\fR
and
\fB%opportunisticgroup\fR
makes this a policy group conn: one that will be instantiated into a regular or opportunistic conn for each CIDR block listed in the policy group file with the same name as the conn\&.
.sp
If using IP addresses in combination with NAT, always use the actual local machine\*(Aqs (NAT\*(Aqed) IP address, and if the remote (eg right=) is NAT\*(Aqed as well, the remote\*(Aqs public (\fBnot\fR
NAT\*(Aqed) IP address\&. Note that this makes the configuration no longer symmetrical on both sides, so you cannot use an identical configuration file on both hosts\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBleftsubnet\fR
.RS 4
private subnet behind the left participant, expressed as
\fInetwork\fR\fB/\fR\fInetmask\fR
(actually, any form acceptable to
\fBipsec_ttosubnet\fR(3)); Currentlly, IPv4 and IPv6 ranges are supported\&. if omitted, essentially assumed to be
\fIleft\fR/32, signifying that the left end of the connection goes to the left participant only
.sp
It supports two magic shorthands
\fIvhost:\fR
and
\fIvnet:\fR, which can list subnets in the same syntax as
\fIvirtual_private\fR\&. The value
\fI%priv\fR
expands to the networks specified in
\fIvirtual_private\fR\&. The value
\fI%no\fR
means no subnet\&. A common use for allowing roadwarrios to come in on public IPs or via accepted NATed networks from RFC1918 is to use
\fIleftsubnet=vhost:%no,%priv\fR\&. The
\fIvnet:\fR
option can be used to allow RFC1918 subnets without hardcoding them\&. When using vnet the connection will instantiate, allowing for multiple tunnels with different subnets\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBleftsubnets\fR
.RS 4
specify multiple private subnets behind the left participant, expressed as {
\fInetworkA\fR\fB/\fR\fInetmaskA\fR
\fInetworkB\fR\fB/\fR\fInetmaskB\fR
\fI[\&.\&.\&.]\fR
} If both leftsubnets= and rightsubnets= are defined, all combinations of subnet tunnels will be instantiated\&. You cannot use leftsubnet and leftsubnets together\&. For examples see
\fItesting/pluto/multinet\-*\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBleftprotoport\fR
.RS 4
allowed protocols and ports over connection, also called Port Selectors\&. The argument is in the form
\fIprotocol\fR, which can be a number or a name that will be looked up in
\fI/etc/protocols\fR, such as
\fIleftprotoport=icmp\fR, or in the form of
\fIprotocol/port\fR, such as
\fItcp/smtp\fR\&. Ports can be defined as a number (eg\&. 25) or as a name (eg smtp) which will be looked up in
\fI/etc/services\fR\&. A special keyword
\fI%any\fR
can be used to allow all ports of a certain protocol\&. The most common use of this option is for L2TP connections to only allow l2tp packets (UDP port 1701), eg:
\fIleftprotoport=17/1701\fR\&. Some clients, notably older Windows XP and some Mac OSX clients, use a random high port as source port\&. In those cases
\fIrightprotoport=17/%any\fR
can be used to allow all UDP traffic on the connection\&. Note that this option is part of the proposal, so it cannot be arbitrarily left out if one end does not care about the traffic selection over this connection \- both peers have to agree\&. The Port Selectors show up in the output of
\fIipsec eroute\fR
and
\fIipsec auto \-\-status\fR
eg:\fI"l2tp": 193\&.110\&.157\&.131[@aivd\&.xelernace\&.com]:7/1701\&.\&.\&.%any:17/1701\fR
This option only filters outbound traffic\&. Inbound traffic selection must still be based on firewall rules activated by an updown script\&. The variablees $PLUTO_MY_PROTOCOL, $PLUTO_PEER_PROTOCOL, $PLUTO_MY_PORT, and $PLUTO_PEER_PORT are available for use in
\fIupdown\fR
scripts\&. Older workarounds for bugs involved a setting of
\fI17/0\fR
to denote
\fIany single UDP port\fR
(not UDP port 0)\&. Some clients, most notably OSX, uses a random high port, instead of port 1701 for L2TP\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBleftnexthop\fR
.RS 4
next\-hop gateway IP address for the left participant\*(Aqs connection to the public network; defaults to
\fB%direct\fR
(meaning
\fIright\fR)\&. If the value is to be overridden by the
\fBleft=%defaultroute\fR
method (see above), an explicit value must
\fInot\fR
be given\&. If that method is not being used, but
\fBleftnexthop\fR
is
\fB%defaultroute\fR, and
\fBinterfaces=%defaultroute\fR
is used in the
\fBconfig\fR
\fBsetup\fR
section, the next\-hop gateway address of the default\-route interface will be used\&. The magic value
\fB%direct\fR
signifies a value to be filled in (by automatic keying) with the peer\*(Aqs address\&. Relevant only locally, other end need not agree on it\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBleftsourceip\fR
.RS 4
the IP address for this host to use when transmitting a packet to the other side of this link\&. Relevant only locally, the other end need not agree\&. This option is used to make the gateway itself use its internal IP, which is part of the leftsubnet, to communicate to the rightsubnet or right\&. Otherwise, it will use its
\fBnearest\fR
IP address, which is its public IP address\&. This option is mostly used when defining subnet\-subnet connections, so that the gateways can talk to each other and the subnet at the other end, without the need to build additional host\-subnet, subnet\-host and host\-host tunnels\&. Both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are supported\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBleftupdown\fR
.RS 4
what \(lqupdown\(rq script to run to adjust routing and/or firewalling when the status of the connection changes (default
\fBipsec _updown\fR)\&. May include positional parameters separated by white space (although this requires enclosing the whole string in quotes); including shell metacharacters is unwise\&. An example to enable routing when using the NETKEY stack, one can use:
.sp
leftupdown="ipsec _updown \-\-route yes"
.sp
See
\fBipsec_pluto\fR(8)
for details\&. Relevant only locally, other end need not agree on it\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBleftfirewall\fR
.RS 4
This option is obsolete and should not used anymore\&.
.RE
.PP
If one or both security gateways are doing forwarding firewalling (possibly including masquerading), and this is specified using the firewall parameters, tunnels established with IPsec are exempted from it so that packets can flow unchanged through the tunnels\&. (This means that all subnets connected in this manner must have distinct, non\-overlapping subnet address blocks\&.) This is done by the default
\fIupdown\fR
script (see
\fBipsec_pluto\fR(8))\&.
.PP
The implementation of this makes certain assumptions about firewall setup, and the availability of the
\fILinux Advanced Routing\fR
tools\&. In situations calling for more control, it may be preferable for the user to supply his own
\fIupdown\fR
script, which makes the appropriate adjustments for his system\&.
.SS "CONN PARAMETERS: AUTOMATIC KEYING"
.PP
The following parameters are relevant only to automatic keying, and are ignored in manual keying\&. Unless otherwise noted, for a connection to work, in general it is necessary for the two ends to agree exactly on the values of these parameters\&.

\fBroute\fR
(signifying that plus an

\fB\-\-route\fR),
\fBstart\fR

\fBipsec auto\fR
\fB\-\-up\fR),

\fBconfig\fR
\fBsetup\fR

Any left out option will be filled in with all allowed default options\&. Multiple proposals are separated by a comma\&. If an

.PP
A connection in

which has
\fBright=%group\fR

.PP
\ \&\ \&\ \&\ \&\ \&\fBipsec auto \-\-rereadgroups\fR
.PP
or at system start, the connection is instantiated such that each CIDR block serves as an instance\*(Aqs
\fBright\fR
value\&. The system treats the resulting instances as normal connections\&.
.PP
For example, given a suitable connection definition
\fBprivate\fR, and the file
/etc/ipsec\&.d/policy/private
with an entry 192\&.0\&.2\&.3, the system creates a connection instance
\fBprivate#192\&.0\&.2\&.3\&.\fR

.SH "DEFAULT POLICY GROUPS"

The standard Openswan install includes several policy groups which provide a way of classifying possible peers into IPsec security classes:

\fBclear\-or\-private\fR

.PP
When choosing a connection to use to respond to a negotiation which doesn\*(Aqt match an ordinary conn, an opportunistic connection may be instantiated\&.

When
\fBtype\fR
or
\fBfailureshunt\fR
is set to
\fBdrop\fR
or
\fBreject,\fR
Openswan blocks outbound packets using eroutes, but assumes inbound blocking is handled by the firewall\&. Openswan offers firewall hooks via an \(lqupdown\(rq script\&. However, the default
\fBipsec _updown\fR
provides no help in controlling a modern firewall\&.
.PP
Including attributes of the keying channel (authentication methods,
\fBikelifetime\fR, etc\&.) as an attribute of a connection, rather than of a participant pair, is dubious and incurs limitations\&.
.PP
The use of
\fB%any\fR
with the
\fIprotoport=\fR
option is ambiguous\&. Should the SA permits any port through or should the SA negotiate any single port through? The first is a basic conn with a wildcard\&. The second is a template\&. The second is the current behaviour, and it\*(Aqs wrong for quite a number of uses involving TCP\&. The keyword
\fB%one\fR
may be introduced in the future to separate these two cases\&.
.PP
\fIipsec_manual\fR
is not nearly as generous about the syntax of subnets, addresses, etc\&. as the usual Openswan user interfaces\&. Four\-component dotted\-decimal must be used for all addresses\&. It
\fIis\fR
smart enough to translate bit\-count netmasks to dotted\-decimal form\&.
.PP
It would be good to have a line\-continuation syntax, especially for the very long lines involved in RSA signature keys\&.
.PP
\fBFirst packet caching\fR
is only implemented for the KLIPS(NG) and MAST stacks\&. NETKEY returns POSIX\-breaking responses, visiable as
\fIconnect: Resource temporarily unavailable\fR
errors\&. This affects Opportunistic Encryption and DPD\&. Functionality on the BSD and Windows stacks is unknown\&.
.PP
Some state information is only available when using KLIPS, and will return errors on other IPsec stacks\&. These include
\fIipsec eroute\fR,
\fIipsec spi\fR
and
\fIipsec look\fR\&.
.PP
Multiple L2TP clients behind the same NAT router, and multiple L2TP clients behind different NAT routers using the same Virtual IP is currently only working for the KLIPSNG stack\&.
.PP
The ability to specify different identities,
\fBauthby\fR, and public keys for different automatic\-keyed connections between the same participants is misleading; this doesn\*(Aqt work dependably because the identity of the participants is not known early enough\&. This is especially awkward for the \(lqRoad Warrior\(rq case, where the remote IP address is specified as
0\&.0\&.0\&.0, and that is considered to be the \(lqparticipant\(rq for such connections\&.
.PP
In principle it might be necessary to control MTU on an interface\-by\-interface basis, rather than with the single global override that
\fBoverridemtu\fR
provides\&. This feature is planned for a future release\&.
.PP
A number of features which
\fIcould\fR
be implemented in both manual and automatic keying actually are not yet implemented for manual keying\&. This is unlikely to be fixed any time soon\&.
.PP
If conns are to be added before DNS is available,
\fBleft=\fR\fIFQDN\fR,
\fBleftnextop=\fR\fIFQDN\fR, and
\fBleftrsasigkey=%dnsonload\fR

\fBipsec_pluto\fR(8)
