/*
 * invoke the updown script to do the routing and firewall commands required
 *
 * The user-specified updown script is run.  Parameters are fed to it in
 * the form of environment variables.  All such environment variables
 * have names starting with "PLUTO_".
 *
 * The operation to be performed is specified by PLUTO_VERB.  This
 * verb has a suffix "-host" if the client on this end is just the
 * host; otherwise the suffix is "-client".  If the address family
 * of the host is IPv6, an extra suffix of "-v6" is added.
 *
 * "prepare-host" and "prepare-client" are used to delete a route
 * that may exist (due to forces outside of Pluto).  It is used to
 * prepare for pluto creating a route.
 *
 * "route-host" and "route-client" are used to install a route.
 * Since routing is based only on destination, the PLUTO_MY_CLIENT_*
 * values are probably of no use (using them may signify a bug).
 *
 * "unroute-host" and "unroute-client" are used to delete a route.
 * Since routing is based only on destination, the PLUTO_MY_CLIENT_*
 * values are probably of no use (using them may signify a bug).
 *
 * "up-host" and "up-client" are run when an eroute is added (not replaced).
 * They are useful for adjusting a firewall: usually for adding a rule
 * to let processed packets flow between clients.  Note that only
 * one eroute may exist for a pair of client subnets but inbound
 * IPsec SAs may persist without an eroute.
 *
 * "down-host" and "down-client" are run when an eroute is deleted.
 * They are useful for adjusting a firewall.
