/* Pluto's uses of randomness:
 *
 * - Setting up the "secret_of_the_day".  This changes every hour!  20
 *   bytes a shot.  It is used in building responder cookies.
 *
 * - generating initiator cookies (8 bytes, once per Phase 1 initiation).
 *
 * - 32 bytes per DH local secret.  Once per Main Mode exchange and once
 *   per Quick Mode Exchange with PFS.  (Size is our choice, with
 *   tradeoffs.)
 *
 * - 16 bytes per nonce we generate.  Once per Main Mode exchange and
 *   once per Quick Mode exchange.  (Again, we choose the size.)
 *
 * - 4 bytes per SPI number that we generate.  We choose the SPIs for all
 *   inbound SPIs, one to three per IPSEC SA (one for AH (rare, probably)
 *   one for ESP (almost always), and one for tunnel (very common)).
 *   I don't actually know how the kernel would generate these numbers --
 *   currently Pluto generates them; this isn't the way things will be
 *   done in the future.
 *
 * - 4 bytes per Message ID we need to generate.  One per Quick Mode
 *   exchange.  Eventually, one per informational exchange.
