.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBpluto\fR
is an IKE (\(lqIPsec Key Exchange\(rq) daemon\&.
\fBwhack\fR
is an auxiliary program to allow requests to be made to a running
\fBpluto\fR\&.
.PP
\fBpluto\fR
is used to automatically build shared \(lqsecurity associations\(rq on a system that has IPsec, the secure IP protocol\&. In other words,
\fBpluto\fR
can eliminate much of the work of manual keying\&. The actual secure transmission of packets is the responsibility of other parts of the system \- the kernel\&. Pluto can talk to various kernel implementations, such as
\fBKLIPS\fR, such as
\fBNETKEY\fR, and such as
\fBKAME\fR
IPsec stacks\&.
\fBipsec_auto\fR(8)
provides a more convenient interface to
\fBpluto\fR
and
\fBwhack\fR\&.
.SS "IKE\'s Job"
.PP
A
\fISecurity Association\fR
(\fISA\fR) is an agreement between two network nodes on how to process certain traffic between them\&. This processing involves encapsulation, authentication, encryption, or compression\&.
.PP
IKE can be deployed on a network node to negotiate Security Associations for that node\&. These IKE implementations can only negotiate with other IKE implementations, so IKE must be on each node that is to be an endpoint of an IKE\-negotiated Security Association\&. No other nodes need to be running IKE\&.
.PP
An IKE instance (i\&.e\&. an IKE implementation on a particular network node) communicates with another IKE instance using UDP IP packets, so there must be a route between the nodes in each direction\&.
.PP
The negotiation of Security Associations requires a number of choices that involve tradeoffs between security, convenience, trust, and efficiency\&. These are policy issues and are normally specified to the IKE instance by the system administrator\&.
.PP
IKE deals with two kinds of Security Associations\&. The first part of a negotiation between IKE instances is to build an ISAKMP SA\&. An ISAKMP SA is used to protect communication between the two IKEs\&. IPsec SAs can then be built by the IKEs \- these are used to carry protected IP traffic between the systems\&.
.PP
The negotiation of the ISAKMP SA is known as Phase 1\&. In theory, Phase 1 can be accomplished by a couple of different exchange types\&. Currently, Main Mode and Aggressive Mode are implemented\&.
.PP
Any negotiation under the protection of an ISAKMP SA, including the negotiation of IPsec SAs, is part of Phase 2\&. The exchange type that we use to negotiate an IPsec SA is called Quick Mode\&.
.PP
IKE instances must be able to authenticate each other as part of their negotiation of an ISAKMP SA\&. This can be done by several mechanisms described in the draft standards\&.
.PP
IKE negotiation can be initiated by any instance with any other\&. If both can find an agreeable set of characteristics for a Security Association, and both recognize each others authenticity, they can set up a Security Association\&. The standards do not specify what causes an IKE instance to initiate a negotiation\&.
.PP
In summary, an IKE instance is prepared to automate the management of Security Associations in an IPsec environment, but a number of issues are considered policy and are left in the system administrator\'s hands\&.
.SS "Pluto"
.PP
\fBpluto\fR
is an implementation of IKE\&. It runs as a daemon on a network node\&. Currently, this network node must be a LINUX system running the
\fBKLIPS\fR
or
\fBNETKEY\fR
implementation of IPsec, or a FreeBSD/NetBSD/Mac OSX system running the
\fBKAME\fR
implementation of IPsec\&.
.PP
\fBpluto\fR
implements a large subset of IKE\&. This is enough for it to interoperate with other instances of
\fBpluto\fR, and many other IKE implementations\&. It currently supports XAUTH, ModeConfig, X\&.509, Dead Peer Detection, Opportunistic Encryption and all the NAT Traversal standards\&.
.PP
The policy for acceptable characteristics for Security Associations is mostly hardwired into the code of
\fBpluto\fR
(spdb\&.c)\&. Eventually this will be moved into a security policy database with reasonable expressive power and more convenience\&.
.PP
\fBpluto\fR
uses shared secrets or RSA signatures to authenticate peers with whom it is negotiating\&. These RSA signatures can come from DNS(SEC), a configuration file, or from X\&.509 and CA certificates\&.
.PP
\fBpluto\fR
initiates negotiation of a Security Association when it is manually prodded: the program
\fBwhack\fR
is run to trigger this\&. It will also initiate a negotiation when
\fBKLIPS\fR
traps an outbound packet for Opportunistic Encryption\&.
.PP
\fBpluto\fR
implements ISAKMP SAs itself\&. After it has negotiated the characteristics of an IPsec SA, it directs the
\fBkernel\fR
to implement it\&. If necessary, it also invokes a script to adjust any firewall and issue
\fBroute\fR(8)
commands to direct IP packets\&.
.PP
When
\fBpluto\fR
shuts down, it closes all Security Associations\&.
.SS "Before Running Pluto"
.PP
\fBpluto\fR
runs as a daemon with userid root\&. Before running it, a few things must be set up\&.
.PP
\fBpluto\fR
requires a working IPsec stack\&.
.PP
\fBpluto\fR
supports multiple public networks (that is, networks that are considered insecure and thus need to have their traffic encrypted or authenticated)\&. It discovers the public interfaces to use by looking at all interfaces that are configured (the
\fB\-\-interface\fR
option can be used to limit the interfaces considered)\&. It does this only when
\fBwhack\fR
tells it to \-\-listen, so the interfaces must be configured by then\&. Each interface with a name of the form
\fBipsec\fR[0\-9] is taken as a
\fBKLIPS\fR
virtual public interface\&. Another network interface with the same IP address (the first one found will be used) is taken as the corresponding real public interface\&. The
\fB\-\-listen\fR
can be used to limit listening on only 1 IP address of a certain interface\&.
\fBifconfig\fR(8)
or
\fBip\fR(8)
with the
\fB\-a\fR
flag will show the name and status of each network interface\&.
.PP
\fBpluto\fR
requires a database of preshared secrets and RSA private keys\&. This is described in the
\fBipsec.secrets\fR(5)\&.
\fBpluto\fR
is told of RSA public keys via
\fBwhack\fR
commands\&. If the connection is Opportunistic, and no RSA public key is known,
\fBpluto\fR
will attempt to fetch RSA keys using the Domain Name System\&.
.SS "Setting up KLIPS for pluto"
.PP
The most basic network topology that
\fBpluto\fR
supports has two security gateways negotiating on behalf of client subnets\&. The diagram of RGB\'s testbed is a good example (see
\fIklips/doc/rgb_setup\&.txt\fR)\&.
.PP
The file
INSTALL
in the base directory of this distribution explains how to start setting up the whole system, including
\fBKLIPS\fR\&.
.PP
Make sure that the security gateways have routes to each other\&. This is usually covered by the default route, but may require issuing
\fBroute\fR(8)
commands\&. The route must go through a particular IP interface (we will assume it is
\fIeth0\fR, but it need not be)\&. The interface that connects the security gateway to its client must be a different one\&.
.PP
It is necessary to issue a
\fBipsec_tncfg\fR(8)
command on each gateway\&. The required command is:
.PP
\ \&\ \&\ \&ipsec tncfg \-\-attach\ \&\-\-virtual\ \&ipsec0 \-\-physical\ \&eth0
.PP
A command to set up the ipsec0 virtual interface will also need to be run\&. It will have the same parameters as the command used to set up the physical interface to which it has just been connected using
\fBipsec_tncfg\fR(8)\&.
.SS "Setting up NETKEY for pluto"
.PP
No special requirements are necessary to use NETKEY \- it ships with all modern versions of Linux 2\&.4 and 2\&.6\&. however, note that certain vendors or older distributions use old versions or backports of NETKEY which are broken\&. If possible use a NETKEY version that is at least based on, or backported from Linux 2\&.6\&.11 or newer\&.
.SS "ipsec\&.secrets file"
.PP
A
\fBpluto\fR
daemon and another IKE daemon (for example, another instance of
\fBpluto\fR) must convince each other that they are who they are supposed to be before any negotiation can succeed\&. This authentication is accomplished by using either secrets that have been shared beforehand (manually) or by using RSA signatures\&. There are other techniques, but they have not been implemented in
\fBpluto\fR\&.
.PP
The file
/etc/ipsec\&.secrets
is used to keep preshared secret keys, RSA private keys, X\&.509 encoded keyfiles and XAUTH passwords\&. Smartcards are handled via NSS\&. For debugging, there is an argument to the
\fBpluto\fR
command to use a different file\&. This file is described in
\fBipsec.secrets\fR(5)\&.
.SS "Running Pluto"
.PP
To fire up the daemon, just type
\fBpluto\fR
(be sure to be running as the superuser)\&. The default IKE port number is 500, the UDP port assigned by IANA for IKE Daemons\&.
\fBpluto\fR
must be run by the superuser to be able to use the UDP 500 port\&. If pluto is told to enable NAT\-Traversal, then UDP port 4500 is also taken by pluto to listen on\&.
.PP
Pluto supports different IPstacks on different operating systems\&. The option
\fB\-\-use\-auto\fR, which is also the default, lets pluto find a stack automatically\&. This behaviour can be changed by explicitly setting the stack using
\fB\-\-use\-klips\fR,
\fB\-\-use\-mast\fR,
\fB\-\-use\-bsdkame\fR
\fB\-\-use\-netkey\fR
or
\fB\-\-use\-nostack\fR\&. The latter is meant for testing only \- no actual IPsec connections will be loaded into the kernel\&.
.PP
Pluto supports the NAT\-Traversal drafts and the final standard, RFC 3947, if the
\fB\-\-nat_traversal\fR
is specified\&. The allowed range behind the NAT routers is submitted using the
\fB\-\-virtual_private\fR
option\&. See
\fBipsec.conf\fR(5)
for the syntax\&. The option
\fB\-\-force_keepalive\fR
forces the sending of the
\fIkeep\-alive packets\fR, which are send to prevent the NAT router from closing its port when there is not enough traffic on the IPsec connection\&. The
\fB\-\-keep_alive\fR
sets the delay (in seconds) of these keep\-alive packets\&. The newer NAT\-T standards support
\fIport floating\fR, and Openswan enables this per default\&. It can be disabled using the
\fB\-\-disable_port_floating\fR
option\&.
.PP
Pluto supports the use of X\&.509 certificates and sends it certificate when needed\&. This can confuse IKE implementations that do not implement this, such as the old FreeS/WAN implementation\&. The
\fB\-\-nocrsend\fR
prevents pluto from sending these\&. At startup, pluto loads all the X\&.509 related files from the directories
/etc/ipsec\&.d/certs,
/etc/ipsec\&.d/cacerts,
/etc/ipsec\&.d/aacerts,
/etc/ipsec\&.d/ocspcerts,
/etc/ipsec\&.d/private
and
/etc/ipsec\&.d/crls\&. The
\fICertificate Revocation Lists\fR
can also be retrieved from an URL\&. The option
\fB\-\-crlcheckinterval\fR
sets the time between checking for CRL expiration and issuing new fetch commands\&. The first attempt to update a CRL is started at
\fI2*crlcheckinterval\fR
before the next update time\&. Pluto logs a warning if no valid CRL was loaded or obtained for a connection\&. If
\fB\-\-strictcrlpolicy\fR
is given, the connection will be rejected until a valid CRL has been loaded\&. Pluto also has support for the
\fIOnline Certificate Store Protocol\fR
(OSCP) as defined in RFC 2560\&. The URL to the OSCP store can be given to pluto via the
\fB\-\-ocspuri\fR
option\&.
.PP
Pluto can use the BIND9 secure resolver, which means it has support for DNSSEC, using the BIND9
\fIlwres {}\fR
interface, see
\fBnamed.conf\fR(5)\&. Pluto can also use the old
\fIadns\fR
interface if there is no BIND9 running with
\fIlwres {}\fR
on the host, but then pluto cannot do any DNSSEC processing\&. Pluto forks and starts these DNS helpers in separate children\&. The options
\fB\-\-lwdnsq\fR
and
\fB\-\-adns\fR
invoke these resolvers\&.
.PP
Pluto can also use helper children to off\-load cryptographic operations\&. This behavior can be fine tuned using the
\fB\-\-nhelpers\fR\&. Pluto will start
\fI(n\-1)\fR
of them, where
\fIn\fR
is the number of CPU\(cqs you have (including hypherthreaded CPU\(cqs)\&. A value of
\fI0\fR
forces pluto to do all operations in the main process\&. A value of
\fI\-1\fR
tells pluto to perform the above calculation\&. Any other value forces the number to that amount\&.
.PP
\fBpluto\fR
attempts to create a lockfile with the name
/var/run/pluto/pluto\&.pid\&. If the lockfile cannot be created,
\fBpluto\fR
exits \- this prevents multiple
\fBpluto\fRs from competing Any \(lqleftover\(rq lockfile must be removed before
\fBpluto\fR
will run\&.
\fBpluto\fR
writes its pid into this file so that scripts can find it\&. This lock will not function properly if it is on an NFS volume (but sharing locks on multiple machines doesn\'t make sense anyway)\&.
.PP
\fBpluto\fR
then forks and the parent exits\&. This is the conventional \(lqdaemon fork\(rq\&. It can make debugging awkward, so there is an option to suppress this fork\&. In certain configurations, pluto might also launch helper programs to assist with DNS queries or to offload cryptographic operations\&.
.PP
All logging, including diagnostics, is sent to
\fBsyslog\fR(3)
with facility=authpriv; it decides where to put these messages (possibly in /var/log/secure)\&. Since this too can make debugging awkward, the option
\fB\-\-stderrlog\fR
is used to steer logging to stderr\&.
.PP
If the
\fB\-\-perpeerlog\fR
option is given, then pluto will open a log file per connection\&. By default, this is in /var/log/pluto/peer, in a subdirectory formed by turning all dot (\&.) [IPv4} or colon (:) [IPv6] into slashes (/)\&.
.PP
The base directory can be changed with the
\fB\-\-perpeerlogbase\fR\&.
.PP
Once
\fBpluto\fR
is started, it waits for requests from
\fBwhack\fR\&.
.SS "Pluto\'s Internal State"
.PP
To understand how to use
\fBpluto\fR, it is helpful to understand a little about its internal state\&. Furthermore, the terminology is needed to decipher some of the diagnostic messages\&.
.PP
Pluto supports
\fBfood groups\fR, and X\&.509 certificates\&. These are located in /etc/ipsec\&.d, or another directory as specified by
\fB\-\-ipsecdir\fR\&.
.PP
Pluto may core dump\&. It will normally do so into the current working directory\&. The standard scripts have an option dumpdir=, which can set the current directory to determine where the core dump will go\&. In some cases, it may be more convenient to specify it on the command line using \-\-coredir\&. A third method is to set the environment variable PLUTO_CORE_DIR\&. The command line argument takes precedence over the environment variable\&. The option plutorestartoncrash can be set to no to prevent multiple core files and a looping pluto process\&. Normally, when pluto crashes, another pluto process is started\&.
.PP
At times it may be desireable to turn off all timed events in
\fBpluto\fR, this can be done with
\fB\-\-noretransmits\fR\&.
.PP
The
\fI(potential) connection\fR
database describes attributes of a connection\&. These include the IP addresses of the hosts and client subnets and the security characteristics desired\&.
\fBpluto\fR
requires this information (simply called a connection) before it can respond to a request to build an SA\&. Each connection is given a name when it is created, and all references are made using this name\&.
.PP
During the IKE exchange to build an SA, the information about the negotiation is represented in a
\fIstate object\fR\&. Each state object reflects how far the negotiation has reached\&. Once the negotiation is complete and the SA established, the state object remains to represent the SA\&. When the SA is terminated, the state object is discarded\&. Each State object is given a serial number and this is used to refer to the state objects in logged messages\&.
.PP
Each state object corresponds to a connection and can be thought of as an instantiation of that connection\&. At any particular time, there may be any number of state objects corresponding to a particular connection\&. Often there is one representing an ISAKMP SA and another representing an IPsec SA\&.
.PP
\fBKLIPS\fR
hooks into the routing code in a LINUX kernel\&. Traffic to be processed by an IPsec SA must be directed through
\fBKLIPS\fR
by routing commands\&. Furthermore, the processing to be done is specified by
\fIipsec eroute(8)\fR
commands\&.
\fBpluto\fR
takes the responsibility of managing both of these special kinds of routes\&.
.PP
\fBNETKEY\fR
requires no special routing\&.
.PP
Each connection may be routed, and must be while it has an IPsec SA\&. The connection specifies the characteristics of the route: the interface on this machine, the \(lqgateway\(rq (the nexthop), and the peer\'s client subnet\&. Two connections may not be simultaneously routed if they are for the same peer\'s client subnet but use different interfaces or gateways (\fBpluto\fR\'s logic does not reflect any advanced routing capabilities)\&.
.PP
On KLIPS, each eroute is associated with the state object for an IPsec SA because it has the particular characteristics of the SA\&. Two eroutes conflict if they specify the identical local and remote clients (unlike for routes, the local clients are taken into account)\&.
.PP
When
\fBpluto\fR
needs to install a route for a connection, it must make sure that no conflicting route is in use\&. If another connection has a conflicting route, that route will be taken down, as long as there is no IPsec SA instantiating that connection\&. If there is such an IPsec SA, the attempt to install a route will fail\&.
.PP
There is an exception\&. If
\fBpluto\fR, as Responder, needs to install a route to a fixed client subnet for a connection, and there is already a conflicting route, then the SAs using the route are deleted to make room for the new SAs\&. The rationale is that the new connection is probably more current\&. The need for this usually is a product of Road Warrior connections (these are explained later; they cannot be used to initiate)\&.
.PP
When
\fBpluto\fR
needs to install an eroute for an IPsec SA (for a state object), first the state object\'s connection must be routed (if this cannot be done, the eroute and SA will not be installed)\&. If a conflicting eroute is already in place for another connection, the eroute and SA will not be installed (but note that the routing exception mentioned above may have already deleted potentially conflicting SAs)\&. If another IPsec SA for the same connection already has an eroute, all its outgoing traffic is taken over by the new eroute\&. The incoming traffic will still be processed\&. This characteristic is exploited during rekeying\&.
.PP
All of these routing characteristics are expected change when
\fBKLIPS\fR
and
\fBNETKEY\fR
merge into a single new stack\&.
.SS "Using Whack"
.PP
\fBwhack\fR
is used to command a running
\fBpluto\fR\&.
\fBwhack\fR
uses a UNIX domain socket to speak to
\fBpluto\fR
(by default,
/var/pluto\&.ctl)\&.
.PP
\fBwhack\fR
has an intricate argument syntax\&. This syntax allows many different functions to be specified\&. The help form shows the usage or version information\&. The connection form gives
\fBpluto\fR
a description of a potential connection\&. The public key form informs
\fBpluto\fR
of the RSA public key for a potential peer\&. The delete form deletes a connection description and all SAs corresponding to it\&. The listen form tells
\fBpluto\fR
to start or stop listening on the public interfaces for IKE requests from peers\&. The route form tells
\fBpluto\fR
to set up routing for a connection; the unroute form undoes this\&. The initiate form tells
\fBpluto\fR
to negotiate an SA corresponding to a connection\&. The terminate form tells
\fBpluto\fR
to remove all SAs corresponding to a connection, including those being negotiated\&. The status form displays the
\fBpluto\fR\'s internal state\&. The debug form tells
\fBpluto\fR
to change the selection of debugging output \(lqon the fly\(rq\&. The shutdown form tells
\fBpluto\fR
to shut down, deleting all SAs\&.
.PP
The crash option asks pluto to consider a particularly target IP to have crashed, and to attempt to restart all connections with that IP address as a gateway\&. In general, you should use Dead Peer Detection to detect this kind of situation automatically, but this is not always possible\&.
.PP
Most options are specific to one of the forms, and will be described with that form\&. There are three options that apply to all forms\&.

\fBpluto\fR

.PP
A similar trick is used in the flags\&. The same flag names are used for both ends\&. Those before the
\fB\-\-to\fR
flag describe the left side and those afterwards describe the right side\&. When
\fBpluto\fR
attempts to use the connection, it decides whether it is the left side or the right side of the connection, based on the IP numbers of its interfaces\&.
.PP
\fB\-\-id\fR\ \&\fIid\fR

Currently, this can be an IP address (specified as dotted quad or as a Fully Qualified Domain Name, which will be resolved immediately) or as a Fully Qualified Domain Name itself (prefixed by \(lq@\(rq to signify that it should not be resolved), or as user@FQDN, or an X\&.509 DN, or as the magic value
\fB%myid\fR\&.
\fBPluto\fR
only authenticates the identity, and does not use it for addressing, so, for example, an IP address need not be the one to which packets are to be sent\&. If the option is absent, the identity defaults to the IP address specified by
\fB\-\-host\fR\&.
\fB%myid\fR
allows the identity to be separately specified (by the
\fBpluto\fR

\fBwhack\fR
option
\fB\-\-myid\fR
or by the
\fBipsec.conf\fR(5)
\fBconfig setup\fR

\fB\-\-dontrekey\fR

A misnomer\&. Only rekey a connection if we were the Initiator and there was recent traffic on the existing connection\&. This applies to Phase 1 and Phase 2\&. This is currently the only automatic way for a connection to terminate\&. It may be useful with Road Warrior or Opportunistic connections\&.
Since SA lifetime negotiation is take\-it\-or\-leave it, a Responder normally uses the shorter of the negotiated or the configured lifetime\&. This only works because if the lifetime is shorter than negotiated, the Responder will rekey in time so that everything works\&. This interacts badly with
\fB\-\-dontrekey\fR\&. In this case, the Responder will end up rekeying to rectify a shortfall in an IPsec SA lifetime; for an ISAKMP SA, the Responder will accept the negotiated lifetime\&.

.SS "Rekeying"
.PP
When an SA that was initiated by
\fBpluto\fR
has only a bit of lifetime left,
\fBpluto\fR
will initiate the creation of a new SA\&. This applies to ISAKMP and IPsec SAs\&. The rekeying will be initiated when the SA\'s remaining lifetime is less than the rekeymargin plus a random percentage, between 0 and rekeyfuzz, of the rekeymargin\&.
.PP
Similarly, when an SA that was initiated by the peer has only a bit of lifetime left,
\fBpluto\fR
will try to initiate the creation of a replacement\&. To give preference to the initiator, this rekeying will only be initiated when the SA\'s remaining lifetime is half of rekeymargin\&. If rekeying is done by the responder, the roles will be reversed: the responder for the old SA will be the initiator for the replacement\&. The former initiator might also initiate rekeying, so there may be redundant SAs created\&. To avoid these complications, make sure that rekeymargin is generous\&.
.PP
One risk of having the former responder initiate is that perhaps none of its proposals is acceptable to the former initiator (they have not been used in a successful negotiation)\&. To reduce the chances of this happening, and to prevent loss of security, the policy settings are taken from the old SA (this is the case even if the former initiator is initiating)\&. These may be stricter than those of the connection\&.
.PP
\fBpluto\fR
will not rekey an SA if that SA is not the most recent of its type (IPsec or ISAKMP) for its potential connection\&. This avoids creating redundant SAs\&.
.PP
The random component in the rekeying time (rekeyfuzz) is intended to make certain pathological patterns of rekeying unstable\&. If both sides decide to rekey at the same time, twice as many SAs as necessary are created\&. This could become a stable pattern without the randomness\&.
.PP
Another more important case occurs when a security gateway has SAs with many other security gateways\&. Each of these connections might need to be rekeyed at the same time\&. This would cause a high peek requirement for resources (network bandwidth, CPU time, entropy for random numbers)\&. The rekeyfuzz can be used to stagger the rekeying times\&.
.PP
Once a new set of SAs has been negotiated,
\fBpluto\fR
will never send traffic on a superseded one\&. Traffic will be accepted on an old SA until it expires\&.
.SS "Selecting a Connection When Responding: Road Warrior Support"
.PP
When
\fBpluto\fR
receives an initial Main Mode message, it needs to decide which connection this message is for\&. It picks based solely on the source and destination IP addresses of the message\&. There might be several connections with suitable IP addresses, in which case one of them is arbitrarily chosen\&. (The ISAKMP SA proposal contained in the message could be taken into account, but it is not\&.)
.PP
The ISAKMP SA is negotiated before the parties pass further identifying information, so all ISAKMP SA characteristics specified in the connection description should be the same for every connection with the same two host IP addresses\&. At the moment, the only characteristic that might differ is authentication method\&.
.PP
Up to this point, all configuring has presumed that the IP addresses are known to all parties ahead of time\&. This will not work when either end is mobile (or assigned a dynamic IP address for other reasons)\&. We call this situation \(lqRoad Warrior\(rq\&. It is fairly tricky and has some important limitations, most of which are features of the IKE protocol\&.
.PP
Only the initiator may be mobile: the initiator may have an IP number unknown to the responder\&. When the responder doesn\'t recognize the IP address on the first Main Mode packet, it looks for a connection with itself as one end and
\fB%any\fR
as the other\&. If it cannot find one, it refuses to negotiate\&. If it does find one, it creates a temporary connection that is a duplicate except with the
\fB%any\fR
replaced by the source IP address from the packet; if there was no identity specified for the peer, the new IP address will be used\&.
.PP
When
\fBpluto\fR
is using one of these temporary connections and needs to find the preshared secret or RSA private key in
\fIipsec\&.secrets\fR, and and the connection specified no identity for the peer,
\fB%any\fR
is used as its identity\&. After all, the real IP address was apparently unknown to the configuration, so it is unreasonable to require that it be used in this table\&.
.PP
Part way into the Phase 1 (Main Mode) negotiation using one of these temporary connection descriptions,
\fBpluto\fR
will be receive an Identity Payload\&. At this point,
\fBpluto\fR
checks for a more appropriate connection, one with an identity for the peer that matches the payload but which would use the same keys so\-far used for authentication\&. If it finds one, it will switch to using this better connection (or a temporary derived from this, if it has
\fB%any\fR
for the peer\'s IP address)\&. It may even turn out that no connection matches the newly discovered identity, including the current connection; if so,
\fBpluto\fR
terminates negotiation\&.
.PP
Unfortunately, if preshared secret authentication is being used, the Identity Payload is encrypted using this secret, so the secret must be selected by the responder without knowing this payload\&. This limits there to being at most one preshared secret for all Road Warrior systems connecting to a host\&. RSA Signature authentications does not require that the responder know how to select the initiator\'s public key until after the initiator\'s Identity Payload is decoded (using the responder\'s private key, so that must be preselected)\&.
.PP
When
\fBpluto\fR
is responding to a Quick Mode negotiation via one of these temporary connection descriptions, it may well find that the subnets specified by the initiator don\'t match those in the temporary connection description\&. If so, it will look for a connection with matching subnets, its own host address, a peer address of
\fB%any\fR
and matching identities\&. If it finds one, a new temporary connection is derived from this one and used for the Quick Mode negotiation of IPsec SAs\&. If it does not find one,
\fBpluto\fR
terminates negotiation\&.
.PP
Be sure to specify an appropriate nexthop for the responder to send a message to the initiator:
\fBpluto\fR
has no way of guessing it (if forwarding isn\'t required, use an explicit
\fB%direct\fR
as the nexthop and the IP address of the initiator will be filled in; the obsolete notation
0\&.0\&.0\&.0
is still accepted)\&.
.PP
\fBpluto\fR
has no special provision for the initiator side\&. The current (possibly dynamic) IP address and nexthop must be used in defining connections\&. These must be properly configured each time the initiator\'s IP address changes\&.
\fBpluto\fR
has no mechanism to do this automatically\&.
.PP
Although we call this Road Warrior Support, it could also be used to support encrypted connections with anonymous initiators\&. The responder\'s organization could announce the preshared secret that would be used with unrecognized initiators and let anyone connect\&. Of course the initiator\'s identity would not be authenticated\&.
.PP
If any Road Warrior connections are supported,
\fBpluto\fR
cannot reject an exchange initiated by an unknown host until it has determined that the secret is not shared or the signature is invalid\&. This must await the third Main Mode message from the initiator\&. If no Road Warrior connection is supported, the first message from an unknown source would be rejected\&. This has implications for ease of debugging configurations and for denial of service attacks\&.
.PP
Although a Road Warrior connection must be initiated by the mobile side, the other side can and will rekey using the temporary connection it has created\&. If the Road Warrior wishes to be able to disconnect, it is probably wise to set
\fB\-\-keyingtries\fR
to 1 in the connection on the non\-mobile side to prevent it trying to rekey the connection\&. Unfortunately, there is no mechanism to unroute the connection automatically\&.

Hint: ISAKMP SAs are often kept alive by IKEs even after the IPsec SA is established\&. This allows future IPsec SA\'s to be negotiated directly\&. If one of the IKEs is restarted, the other may try to use the ISAKMP SA but the new IKE won\'t know about it\&. This can lead to much confusion\&.
\fBpluto\fR
is not yet smart enough to get out of such a mess\&.
.SS "Pluto\'s Behaviour When Things Go Wrong"
.PP
When
\fBpluto\fR
doesn\'t understand or accept a message, it just ignores the message\&. It is not yet capable of communicating the problem to the other IKE daemon (in the future it might use Notifications to accomplish this in many cases)\&. It does log a diagnostic\&.
.PP
When
\fBpluto\fR
gets no response from a message, it resends the same message (a message will be sent at most three times)\&. This is appropriate: UDP is unreliable\&.
.PP
When pluto gets a message that it has already seen, there are many cases when it notices and discards it\&. This too is appropriate for UDP\&.
.PP
Combine these three rules, and you can explain many apparently mysterious behaviours\&. In a
\fBpluto\fR
log, retrying isn\'t usually the interesting event\&. The critical thing is either earlier (\fBpluto\fR
got a message which it didn\'t like and so ignored, so it was still awaiting an acceptable message and got impatient) or on the other system (\fBpluto\fR
didn\'t send a reply because it wasn\'t happy with the previous message)\&.
.SS "Notes"
.PP
If
\fBpluto\fR
is compiled without \-DKLIPS, it negotiates Security Associations but never ask the kernel to put them in place and never makes routing changes\&. This allows
\fBpluto\fR
to be tested on systems without
\fBKLIPS\fR, but makes it rather useless\&.
.PP
Each IPsec SA is assigned an SPI, a 32\-bit number used to refer to the SA\&. The IKE protocol lets the destination of the SA choose the SPI\&. The range 0 to 0xFF is reserved for IANA\&.
\fBPluto\fR
also avoids choosing an SPI in the range 0x100 to 0xFFF, leaving these SPIs free for manual keying\&. Remember that the peer, if not
\fBpluto\fR, may well chose SPIs in this range\&.
.SS "Policies"
.PP
This catalogue of policies may be of use when trying to configure
\fBPluto\fR
and another IKE implementation to interoperate\&.
.PP
In Phase 1, only Main Mode is supported\&. We are not sure that Aggressive Mode is secure\&. For one thing, it does not support identity protection\&. It may allow more severe Denial Of Service attacks\&.
.PP
No Informational Exchanges are supported\&. These are optional and since their delivery is not assured, they must not matter\&. It is the case that some IKE implementations won\'t interoperate without Informational Exchanges, but we feel they are broken\&.

.SH "BUGS"
.PP
\fBpluto\fR
is a work\-in\-progress\&. It currently has many limitations\&. For example, it ignores notification messages that it receives, and it generates only Delete Notifications and those only for IPSEC SAs\&.
.PP
\fBpluto\fR
does not support the Commit Flag\&. The Commit Flag is a bad feature of the IKE protocol\&. It isn\'t protected \-\- neither encrypted nor authenticated\&. A man in the middle could turn it on, leading to DoS\&. We just ignore it, with a warning\&. This should let us interoperate with implementations that insist on it, with minor damage\&.
.PP
\fBpluto\fR
does not check that the SA returned by the Responder is actually one that was proposed\&. It only checks that the SA is acceptable\&. The difference is not large, but can show up in attributes such as SA lifetime\&.
.PP
There is no good way for a connection to be automatically terminated\&. This is a problem for Road Warrior and Opportunistic connections\&. The
\fB\-\-dontrekey\fR
option does prevent the SAs from being rekeyed on expiry\&. Additonally, if a Road Warrior connection has a client subnet with a fixed IP address, a negotiation with that subnet will cause any other connection instantiations with that same subnet to be unoriented (deleted, in effect)\&. See also the \-\-uniqueids option for an extension of this\&.
.PP
When
\fBpluto\fR
sends a message to a peer that has disappeared,
\fBpluto\fR
receives incomplete information from the kernel, so it logs the unsatisfactory message \(lqsome IKE message we sent has been rejected with ECONNREFUSED (kernel supplied no details)\(rq\&. John Denker suggests that this command is useful for tracking down the source of these problems:
tcpdump \-i eth0 icmp[0] != 8 and icmp[0] != 0
Substitute your public interface for eth0 if it is different\&.
.PP
The word \(lqauthenticate\(rq is used for two different features\&. We must authenticate each IKE peer to the other\&. This is an important task of Phase 1\&. Each packet must be authenticated, both in IKE and in IPsec, and the method for IPsec is negotiated as an AH SA or part of an ESP SA\&. Unfortunately, the protocol has no mechanism for authenticating the Phase 2 identities\&.
.PP
Bugs should be reported to the <users@lists\&.openswan\&.org> mailing list\&.
