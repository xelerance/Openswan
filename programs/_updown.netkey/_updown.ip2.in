# Things that this script gets (from ipsec_pluto(8) man page)
#
#
#	PLUTO_VERSION
#		indicates  what	 version of this interface is being
#		used.  This document describes version	1.1.   This
#		is upwardly compatible with version 1.0.
#
#	PLUTO_VERB
#		specifies the name of the operation to be performed
#		(prepare-host, prepare-client, up-host, up-client,
#		down-host, or down-client).  If the address family
#		for security gateway to security gateway
#		communications is IPv6, then a suffix of -v6 is added
#		to the verb.
#
#	PLUTO_CONNECTION
#		is the name of the  connection	for  which  we	are
#		routing.
#
#	PLUTO_CONN_POLICY
#		the policy of the connection, as in:
#		RSASIG+ENCRYPT+TUNNEL+PFS+DONTREKEY+OPPORTUNISTIC
#		+failureDROP+lKOD+rKOD	
#
#	PLUTO_NEXT_HOP
#		is the next hop to which packets bound for the peer
#		must be sent.
#
#	PLUTO_INTERFACE
#		is the name of the ipsec interface to be used.
#
#	PLUTO_ME
#		is the IP address of our host.
#
#	PLUTO_MY_CLIENT
#		is the IP address / count of our client subnet.	 If
#		the  client  is	 just  the  host,  this will be the
#		host's own IP address / max (where max	is  32	for
#		IPv4 and 128 for IPv6).
#
#	PLUTO_MY_CLIENT_NET
#		is the IP address of our client net.  If the client
#		is just the host, this will be the  host's  own	 IP
#		address.
#
#	PLUTO_MY_CLIENT_MASK
#		is  the	 mask for our client net.  If the client is
#		just the host, this will be 255.255.255.255.
#
#	PLUTO_MY_SOURCEIP
#		if non-empty, then the source address for the route will be
#		set to this IP address.
#
#	PLUTO_MY_PROTOCOL
#		is the protocol	 for this  connection.	Useful	for
#		firewalling.
#
#	PLUTO_MY_PORT
#		is the port. Useful for firewalling.
#
#	PLUTO_PEER
#		is the IP address of our peer.
#
#	PLUTO_PEER_CLIENT
#		is the IP address / count of the peer's client sub­
#		net.   If the client is just the peer, this will be
#		the peer's own IP address / max (where	max  is	 32
#		for IPv4 and 128 for IPv6).
#
#	PLUTO_PEER_CLIENT_NET
#		is the IP address of the peer's client net.  If the
#		client is just the peer, this will  be	the  peer's
#		own IP address.
#
#	PLUTO_PEER_CLIENT_MASK
#		is  the	 mask  for  the	 peer's client net.  If the
#		client	 is   just   the   peer,   this	  will	 be
#		255.255.255.255.
#
#	PLUTO_PEER_PROTOCOL
#		is  the	 protocol  set	for  remote  end  with port
#		selector.
#
#	PLUTO_PEER_PORT
#		is the peer's port. Useful for firewalling.
#
#	PLUTO_CONNECTION_TYPE
#
#	PLUTO_PROTO_STACK
#		is the local IPsec kernel stack used, eg KLIPS, NETKEY,
#		NOSTACK
