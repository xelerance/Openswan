.SH "NAME"
ipsec_newhostkey \- generate a new raw RSA authentication key for a host
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP 6
\fBipsec\fR \fInewhostkey\fR [[\-\-quiet] | [\-\-verbose]] [\-\-bits\ \fIbits\fR] [\-\-hostname\ \fIhostname\fR] \-\-output\ \fIfilename\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fInewhostkey\fR
outputs (into
\fIfilename\fR, which can be \'\-\' for standard output) an RSA private key suitable for this host, in
\fI/etc/ipsec\.secrets\fR
format (see
\fBipsec.secrets\fR(5)) using the
\fB\-\-quiet\fR
option per default\.
.PP
The
\fB\-\-output\fR
option is mandatory\. The specified
\fIfilename\fR
is created under umask
\fB077\fR
if nonexistent; if it already exists and is non\-empty, a warning message about that is sent to standard error, and the output is appended to the file\.
.PP
The
\fB\-\-quiet\fR
option suppresses both the
\fIrsasigkey\fR
narrative and the existing\-file warning message\.
.PP
The
\fB\-\-bits\fR
option specifies the number of bits in the key; the current default is 2192 and we do not recommend use of anything shorter unless unusual constraints demand it\.
.PP
The
\fB\-\-hostname\fR
option is passed through to
\fIrsasigkey\fR
to tell it what host name to label the output with (via its
\fB\-\-hostname\fR
option)\.
.PP
The output format is that of
\fIrsasigkey\fR, with bracketing added to complete the
\fIipsec\.secrets\fR
format\. In the usual case, where
\fIipsec\.secrets\fR
contains only the host's own private key, the output of
\fInewhostkey\fR
is sufficient as a complete
\fIipsec\.secrets\fR
file\.

.SH "HISTORY"
.PP
Written for the Linux FreeS/WAN project <\fIhttp://www\.freeswan\.org\fR> by Henry Spencer\.
.SH "BUGS"
.PP
As with
\fIrsasigkey\fR, the run time is difficult to predict, since depletion of the system's randomness pool can cause arbitrarily long waits for random bits, and the prime\-number searches can also take unpre dictable (and potentially large) amounts of CPU time\. See
\fBipsec_rsasigkey\fR(8)
for some typical performance numbers\.
.PP
A higher\-level tool which could handle the clerical details of changing to a new key would be helpful\.
.PP
The requirement for
\fB\-\-output\fR
is a blemish, but private keys are extremely sensitive information and unusual precautions seem justified\.
