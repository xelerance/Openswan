<refsect1 id='description'><title>DESCRIPTION</title>
<para>The <emphasis remap='B'>ipsec lwdnsq</emphasis> is a helper program that does DNS lookups for other programs. It implements an asynchronous interface on stdin/stdout, with an ASCII driven command language.</para>


<para>If stdin is a tty or if the <option>--prompt</option> option is given, then it issues a prompt to the user. Otherwise, it is silent, except for results.</para>


<para>The program will accept multiple queries concurrently, with each result being marked with the ID provided on the output. The IDs are strings.</para>


<para>If the <option>--serial</option> option is given, then the program will not attempt to execute concurrent queries, but will serialize all input and output.</para>

</refsect1>

<refsect1 id='query_language'><title>QUERY LANGUAGE</title>
<para>There are twelve commands that the program understands. This is to lookup different types of records in both the forward and reverse maps. Every query includes a queryid, which is returned in the output, on every single line to identify the transaction.</para>

<para>At the time of this writing, the IPSECKEY resource record is not entirely specified. In particular no resource record number has been assigned. This program assumes that it is resource record number 45. If the file /etc/@IPSEC_CONFDDIR@/lwdnsq.conf exists, and contains a line like</para> 

<literallayout remap='.nf'>

ipseckey_rr=<emphasis remap='B'>number</emphasis>

<para>If the file /etc/@IPSEC_CONFDDIR@/lwdnsq.conf exists, and contains a line like</para> 

<literallayout remap='.nf'>

queryany=false

</literallayout> <!-- .fi -->
<para> then instead of doing an ALL query when looking for OE delegation records, lwdnsq will do a series of queries. It will first look for IPSECKEY, and then TXT record. If it finds neither, it will then look for KEY records of all kinds, although they do not contain delegation information.</para>
