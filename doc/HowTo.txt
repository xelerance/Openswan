                                 Introduction

   This section gives an overview of:
     * what IP Security (IPsec) does
     * how IPsec works
     * why we are implementing it for Linux
     * how this implementation works

   This section is intended to cover only the essentials, things you
   should know before trying to use FreeS/WAN.

   For more detailed background information, see the[714] history and
   politics and[715] IPsec protocols sections.

IPsec, Security for the Internet Protocol

   FreeS/WAN is a Linux implementation of the IPsec (IP security)
   protocols. IPsec provides[716] encryption and[717] authentication
   services at the IP (Internet Protocol) level of the network protocol
   stack.

   Working at this level, IPsec can protect any traffic carried over IP,
   unlike other encryption which generally protects only a particular
   higher-level protocol --[718] PGP for mail,[719] SSH for remote
   login,[720] SSL for web work, and so on. This approach has both
   considerable advantages and some limitations. For discussion, see
   our[721] IPsec section

   IPsec can be used on any machine which does IP networking. Dedicated
   IPsec gateway machines can be installed wherever required to protect
   traffic. IPsec can also run on routers, on firewall machines, on
   various application servers, and on end-user desktop or laptop
   machines.

   Three protocols are used
     * [722]AH (Authentication Header) provides a packet-level
       authentication service
     * [723]ESP (Encapsulating Security Payload) provides encryption plus
       authentication
     * [724]IKE (Internet Key Exchange) negotiates connection parameters,
       including keys, for the other two

   Our implementation has three main parts:
     * [725]KLIPS (kernel IPsec) implements AH, ESP, and packet handling
       within the kernel
     * [726]Pluto (an IKE daemon) implements IKE, negotiating connections
       with other systems
     * various scripts provide an adminstrator's interface to the
       machinery

   IPsec is optional for the current (version 4) Internet Protocol.
   FreeS/WAN adds IPsec to the Linux IPv4 network stack. Implementations
   of[727] IP version 6 are required to include IPsec. Work toward
   integrating FreeS/WAN into the Linux IPv6 stack has[728] started.

   For more information on IPsec, see our[729] IPsec protocols section,
   our collection of[730] IPsec links or the[731] RFCs which are the
   official definitions of these protocols.

  Interoperating with other IPsec implementations

   IPsec is designed to let different implementations work together. We
   provide:
     * a[732] list of some other implementations
     * information on[733] using FreeS/WAN with other implementations

   The VPN Consortium fosters cooperation among implementers and
   interoperability among implementations. Their[734] web site has much
   more information.

  Advantages of IPsec

   IPsec has a number of security advantages. Here are some independently
   written articles which discuss these:

   [735]SANS institute papers. See the section on Encryption &VPNs.
   [736]Cisco's white papers on "Networking Solutions".
   [737]Advantages of ISCS (Linux Integrated Secure Communications
   System; includes FreeS/WAN and other software).

  Applications of IPsec

   Because IPsec operates at the network layer, it is remarkably flexible
   and can be used to secure nearly any type of Internet traffic. Two
   applications, however, are extremely widespread:
     * a[738] Virtual Private Network, or VPN, allows multiple sites to
       communicate securely over an insecure Internet by encrypting all
       communication between the sites.
     * "Road Warriors" connect to the office from home, or perhaps from a
       hotel somewhere

   There is enough opportunity in these applications that vendors are
   flocking to them. IPsec is being built into routers, into firewall
   products, and into major operating systems, primarily to support these
   applications. See our[739] list of implementations for details.

   We support both of those applications, and various less common IPsec
   applications as well, but we also add one of our own:
     * opportunistic encryption, the ability to set up FreeS/WAN gateways
       so that any two of them can encrypt to each other, and will do so
       whenever packets pass between them.

   This is an extension we are adding to the protocols. FreeS/WAN is the
   first prototype implementation, though we hope other IPsec
   implementations will adopt the technique once we demonstrate it.
   See[740] project goals below for why we think this is important.

   A somewhat more detailed description of each of these applications is
   below. Our[741] quickstart section will show you how to build each of
   them.

    Using secure tunnels to create a VPN

   A VPN, or Virtual Private N etwork lets two networks communicate
   securely when the only connection between them is over a third network
   which they do not trust.

   The method is to put a security gateway machine between each of the
   communicating networks and the untrusted network. The gateway machines
   encrypt packets entering the untrusted net and decrypt packets leaving
   it, creating a secure tunnel through it.

   If the cryptography is strong, the implementation is careful, and the
   administration of the gateways is competent, then one can reasonably
   trust the security of the tunnel. The two networks then behave like a
   single large private network, some of whose links are encrypted
   tunnels through untrusted nets.

   Actual VPNs are often more complex. One organisation may have fifty
   branch offices, plus some suppliers and clients, with whom it needs to
   communicate securely. Another might have 5,000 stores, or 50,000
   point-of-sale devices. The untrusted network need not be the Internet.
   All the same issues arise on a corporate or institutional network
   whenever two departments want to communicate privately with each
   other.

   Administratively, the nice thing about many VPN setups is that large
   parts of them are static. You know the IP addresses of most of the
   machines involved. More important, you know they will not change on
   you. This simplifies some of the admin work. For cases where the
   addresses do change, see the next section.

    Road Warriors

   The prototypical "Road Warrior" is a traveller connecting to home base
   from a laptop machine. Administratively, most of the same problems
   arise for a telecommuter connecting from home to the office,
   especially if the telecommuter does not have a static IP address.

   For purposes of this document:
     * anyone with a dynamic IP address is a "Road Warrior".
     * any machine doing IPsec processing is a "gateway". Think of the
       single-user road warrior machine as a gateway with a degenerate
       subnet (one machine, itself) behind it.

   These require somewhat different setup than VPN gateways with static
   addresses and with client systems behind them, but are basically not
   problematic.

   There are some difficulties which appear for some road warrior
   connections:
     * Road Wariors who get their addresses via DHCP may have a problem.
       FreeS/WAN can quite happily build and use a tunnel to such an
       address, but when the DHCP lease expires, FreeS/WAN does not know
       that. The tunnel fails, and the only recovery method is to tear it
       down and re-build it.
     * If[742] Network Address Translation (NAT) is applied between the
       two IPsec Gateways, this breaks IPsec. IPsec authenticates packets
       on an end-to-end basis, to ensure they are not altered en route.
       NAT rewrites packets as they go by. See our[743] firewalls
       document for details.

   In most situations, however, FreeS/WAN supports road warrior
   connections just fine.

    Opportunistic encryption

   One of the reasons we are working on FreeS/WAN is that it gives us the
   opportunity to add what we call opportuntistic encryption. This means
   that any two FreeS/WAN gateways will be able to encrypt their traffic,
   even if the two gateway administrators have had no prior contact and
   neither system has any preset information about the other.

   Both systems pick up the authentication information they need from
   the[744] DNS (domain name service), the service they already use to
   look up IP addresses. Of course the administrators must put that
   information in the DNS, and must set up their gateways with
   opportunistic encryption enabled. Once that is done, everything is
   automatic. The gateways look for opportunities to encrypt, and encrypt
   whatever they can. Whether they also accept unencrypted communication
   is a policy decision the administrator can make.

   This technique can give two large payoffs:
     * It reduces the administrative overhead for IPsec enormously. You
       configure your gateway and thereafter everything is automatic. The
       need to configure the system on a per-tunnel basis disappears. Of
       course, FreeS/WAN allows specifically configured tunnels to
       co-exist with opportunistic encryption, but we hope to make them
       unnecessary in most cases.
     * It moves us toward a more secure Internet, allowing users to
       create an environment where message privacy is the default. All
       messages can be encrypted, provided the other end is willing to
       co-operate. See our[745] history and politics of cryptography
       section for discussion of why we think this is needed.

   Opportunistic encryption is not (yet?) a standard part of the IPsec
   protocols, but an extension we are proposing and demonstrating. For
   details of our design, see[746] links below.

   Only one current product we know of implements a form of opportunistic
   encryption.[747] Secure sendmail will automatically encrypt
   server-to-server mail transfers whenever possible.

  The need to authenticate gateways

   A complication, which applies to any type of connection -- VPN, Road
   Warrior or opportunistic -- is that a secure connection cannot be
   created magically. There must be some mechanism which enables the
   gateways to reliably identify each other. Without this, they cannot
   sensibly trust each other and cannot create a genuinely secure link.

   Any link they do create without some form of[748] authentication will
   be vulnerable to a[749] man-in-the-middle attack. If[750] Alice and
   Bob are the people creating the connection, a villian who can re-route
   or intercept the packets can pose as Alice while talking to Bob and
   pose as Bob while talking to Alice. Alice and Bob then both talk to
   the man in the middle, thinking they are talking to each other, and
   the villain gets everything sent on the bogus "secure" connection.

   There are two ways to build links securely, both of which exclude the
   man-in-the middle:
     * with manual keying, Alice and Bob share a secret key (which must
       be transmitted securely, perhaps in a note or via PGP or SSH) to
       encrypt their messages. For FreeS/WAN, such keys are stored in
       the[751] ipsec.conf(5) file. Of course, if an enemy gets the key,
       all is lost.
     * with automatic keying, the two systems authenticate each other and
       negotiate their own secret keys. The keys are automatically
       changed periodically.

   Automatic keying is much more secure, since if an enemy gets one key
   only messages between the previous re-keying and the next are exposed.
   It is therefore the usual mode of operation for most IPsec deployment,
   and the mode we use in our setup examples. FreeS/WAN does support
   manual keying for special circumstanes. See this[752] section.

   For automatic keying, the two systems must authenticate each other
   during the negotiations. There is a choice of methods for this:
     * a shared secret provides authentication. If Alice and Bob are the
       only ones who know a secret and Alice recives a message which
       could not have been created without that secret, then Alice can
       safely believe the message came from Bob.
     * a[753] public key can also provide authentication. If Alice
       receives a message signed with Bob's private key (which of course
       only he should know) and she has a trustworthy copy of his public
       key (so that she can verify the signature), then she can safely
       believe the message came from Bob.

   Public key techniques are much preferable, for reasons discussed[754]
   later, and will be used in all our setup examples. FreeS/WAN does also
   support auto-keying with shared secret authentication. See this[755]
   section.

The FreeS/WAN project

   For complete information on the project, see our web site,[756]
   freeswan.org.

   In summary, we are implementing the[757] IPsec protocols for Linux and
   extending them to do[758] opportunistic encryption.

  Project goals

   Our overall goal in FreeS/WAN is to make the Internet more secure and
   more private.

   Our IPsec implementation supports VPNs and Road Warriors of course.
   Those are important applications. Many users will want FreeS/WAN to
   build corporate VPNs or to provide secure remote access.

   However, our goals in building it go beyond that. We are trying to
   help build security into the fabric of the Internet so that anyone who
   choses to communicate securely can do so, as easily as they can do
   anything else on the net.

   More detailed objectives are:
     * extend IPsec to do[759] opportunistic encryption so that
          + any two systems can secure their communications without a
            pre-arranged connection
          + secure connections can be the default, falling back to
            unencrypted connections only if:

   deployed, then it becomes impossible for even huge well-funded
   agencies to monitor the net.

   See also our section on[765] history and politics of cryptography,
   which includes our project leader's[766] rationale for starting the
   project.

  Project team

   Two of the team are from the US and can therefore contribute no code:
     * John Gilmore: founder and policy-maker ([767] home page)
     * Hugh Daniel: project manager, Most Demented Tester, and
       occasionally Pointy-Haired Boss

   The rest of the team are Canadians, working in Canada. ([768] Why
   Canada?)
     * Hugh Redelmeier:[769] Pluto daemon programmer
     * Richard Guy Briggs:[770] KLIPS programmer
     * Michael Richardson: hacker without portfolio
     * Claudia Schmeing: documentation
     * Sam Sgro: technical support via the[771] mailing lists

   The project is funded by civil libertarians who consider our goals
   worthwhile. Most of the team are paid for this work.

   People outside this core team have made substantial contributions. See
     * our[772] CREDITS file
     * the[773] patches and add-ons section of our web references file
     * lists below of user-written[774] HowTos and[775] other papers

   Additional contributions are welcome. See the[776] FAQ for details.

Products containing FreeS/WAN

   Unfortunately the[777] export laws of some countries restrict the
   distribution of strong cryptography. FreeS/WAN is therefore not in the
   standard Linux kernel and not in all CD or web distributions.

   FreeS/WAN is, however, quite widely used. Products we know of that use
   it are listed below. We would appreciate hearing, via the[778] mailing
   lists, of any we don't know of.

  Full Linux distributions

   FreeS/WAN is included in various general-purpose Linux distributions,
   mostly from countries (shown in brackets) with more sensible laws:
     * [779]SuSE Linux (Germany)
     * [780]Conectiva (Brazil)
     * [781]Mandrake (France)
     * [782]Debian
     * the[783] Polish(ed) Linux Distribution (Poland)
     * Best Linux (Finland)

   For distributions which do not include FreeS/WAN and are not Redhat
   (which we develop and test on), there is additional information in
   our[784] compatibility section.

   The server edition of[785] Corel Linux (Canada) also had FreeS/WAN,
   but Corel have dropped that product line.

  Linux kernel distributions

     * [786]Working Overloaded Linux Kernel (WOLK)

  Office server distributions

   FreeS/WAN is also included in several distributions aimed at the
   market for turnkey business servers:
     * [787]e-Smith (Canada), which has recently been acquired and become
       the Network Server Solutions group of[788] Mitel Networks (Canada)
     * [789]ClarkConnect from Point Clark Networks (Canada)
     * [790]Trustix Secure Linux (Norway)

  Firewall distributions

   Several distributions intended for firewall and router applications
   include FreeS/WAN:
     * The[791] Linux Router Project produces a Linux distribution that
       will boot from a single floppy. The[792] LEAF firewall project
       provides several different LRP-based firewall packages. At least
       one of them, Charles Steinkuehler's Dachstein, includes FreeS/WAN
       with X.509 patches.
     * there are several distributions bootable directly from CD-ROM,
       usable on a machine without hard disk.
          + Dachstein (see above) can be used this way
          + [793]Gibraltar is based on Debian GNU/Linux.
          + at time of writing,[794] Xiloo is available only in Chinese.
            An English version is expected.
     * [795]Astaro Security Linux includes FreeS/WAN. It has some
       web-based tools for managing the firewall that include FreeS/WAN
       configuration management.
     * [796]Linuxwall
     * [797]Smoothwall
     * [798]Devil Linux
     * Coyote Linux has a[799] Wolverine firewall/VPN server

   There are also several sets of scripts available for managing a
   firewall which is also acting as a FreeS/WAN IPsec gateway. See
   this[800] list.

  Firewall and VPN products

   Several vendors use FreeS/WAN as the IPsec component of a turnkey
   firewall or VPN product.

   Software-only products:
     * [801]Linux Magic offer a VPN/Firewall product using FreeS/WAN
     * The Software Group's[802] Sentinet product uses FreeS/WAN
     * [803]Merilus use FreeS/WAN in their Gateway Guardian firewall
       product

   Products that include the hardware:
     * The[804] LASAT SafePipe[tm] series. is an IPsec box based on an
       embedded MIPS running Linux with FreeS/WAN and a web-config front
       end. This company also host our freeswan.org web site.
     * Merilus[805] Firecard is a Linux firewall on a PCI card.
     * [806]Kyzo have a "pizza box" product line with various types of
       server, all running from flash. One of them is an IPsec/PPTP VPN
       server
     * [807]PFN use FreeS/WAN in some of their products

   [808]Rebel.com, makers of the Netwinder Linux machines (ARM or Crusoe
   based), had a product that used FreeS/WAN. The company is in
   receivership so the future of the Netwinder is at best unclear.[809]
   PKIX patches for FreeS/WAN developed at Rebel are listed in our web
   links document.

Information sources

  This HowTo, in multiple formats

   FreeS/WAN documentation up to version 1.5 was available only in HTML.
   Now we ship two formats:
     * as HTML, one file for each doc section plus a global[810] Table of
       Contents
     * [811]one big HTML file for easy searching

   and provide a Makefile to generate other formats if required:
     * [812]PDF
     * [813]Postscript
     * [814]ASCII text

   The Makefile assumes the htmldoc tool is available. You can download
   it from[815] Easy Software.

   All formats should be available at the following websites:
     * [816]FreeS/WAN project
     * [817]Linux Documentation Project

   The distribution tarball has only the two HTML formats.

   Note: If you need the latest doc version, for example to see if anyone
   has managed to set up interoperation between FreeS/WAN and whatever,
   then you should download the current snapshot. What is on the web is
   documentation as of the last release. Snapshots have all changes I've
   checked in to date.

  RTFM (please Read The Fine Manuals)

   As with most things on any Unix-like system, most parts of Linux
   FreeS/WAN are documented in online manual pages. We provide a list
   of[818] FreeS/WAN man pages, with links to HTML versions of them.

   The man pages describing configuration files are:
     * [819]ipsec.conf(5)
     * [820]ipsec.secrets(5)

   Man pages for common commands include:
     * [821]ipsec(8)
     * [822]ipsec_pluto(8)
     * [823]ipsec_newhostkey(8)
     * [824]ipsec_auto(8)

   You can read these either in HTML using the links above or with the
   man(1) command.

   In the event of disagreement between this HTML documentation and the
   man pages, the man pages are more likely correct since they are
   written by the implementers. Please report any such inconsistency on
   the[825] mailing list.

  Other documents in the distribution

   Text files in the main distribution directory are README, INSTALL,
   CREDITS, CHANGES, BUGS and COPYING.

   The Libdes encryption library we use has its own documentation. You
   can find it in the library directory..

  Background material

   Throughout this documentation, I write as if the reader had at least a
   general familiarity with Linux, with Internet Protocol networking, and
   with the basic ideas of system and network security. Of course that
   will certainly not be true for all readers, and quite likely not even
   for a majority.

   However, I must limit amount of detail on these topics in the main
   text. For one thing, I don't understand all the details of those
   topics myself. Even if I did, trying to explain everything here would
   produce extremely long and almost completely unreadable documentation.

   If one or more of those areas is unknown territory for you, there are
   plenty of other resources you could look at:

   Linux
          the[826] Linux Documentation Project or a local[827] Linux User
          Group and these[828] links

   IP networks
          Rusty Russell's[829] Networking Concepts HowTo and these[830]
          links

   Security
          Schneier's book[831] Secrets and Lies and these[832] links

   Also, I do make an effort to provide some background material in these
   documents. All the basic ideas behind IPsec and FreeS/WAN are
   explained here. Explanations that do not fit in the main text, or that
   not everyone will need, are often in the[833] glossary , which is the
   largest single file in this document set. There is also a[834]
   background file containing various explanations too long to fit in
   glossary definitions. All files are heavily sprinkled with links to
   each other and to the glossary. If some passage makes no sense to you,
   try the links.

   For other reference material, see the[835] bibliography and our
   collection of[836] web links.

   Of course, no doubt I get this (and other things) wrong sometimes.
   Feedback via the[837] mailing lists is welcome.

  Archives of the project mailing list

   Until quite recently, there was only one FreeS/WAN mailing list, and
   archives of it were:
     * [838]Canada
     * [839]Holland

   The two archives use completely different search engines. You might
   want to try both.

   More recently we have expanded to five lists, each with its own
   archive.

   [840]More information on mailing lists.

  User-written HowTo information

   Various user-written HowTo documents are available. The ones covering
   FreeS/WAN-to-FreeS/WAN connections are:
     * Jean-Francois Nadeau's[841] practical configurations document
     * Jens Zerbst's HowTo on[842] Using FreeS/WAN with dynamic IP
       addresses.
     * an entry in Kurt Seifried's[843] Linux Security Knowledge Base.
     * a section of David Ranch's[844] Trinity OS Guide
     * a section in David Bander's book[845] Linux Security Toolkit

   User-wriiten HowTo material may be especially helpful if you need to
   interoperate with another IPsec implementation. We have neither the
   equipment nor the manpower to test such configurations. Users seem to
   be doing an admirable job of filling the gaps.
     * list of user-written[846] interoperation HowTos in our interop
       document

   Check what version of FreeS/WAN user-written documents cover. The
   software is under active development and the current version may be
   significantly different from what an older document describes.

  Papers on FreeS/WAN

   Two design documents show team thinking on new developments:
     * [847]Opportunistic Encryption by technical lead Henry Spencer and
       Pluto programmer Hugh Redelemeier
     * discussion of[848] KLIPS redesign

   Both documents are works in progress and are frequently revised. For
   the latest version, see the[849] design mailing list. Comments should
   go to that list.

   There is now an[850] Internet Draft on Opportunistic Encryption by
   Michael Richardson, Hugh Redelmeier and Henry Spencer. This is a first
   step toward getting the protocol standardised so there can be multiple
   implementations of it. Discussion of it takes place on the[851] IETF
   IPsec Working Group mailing list.

   A number of papers giving further background on FreeS/WAN, or
   exploring its future or its applications, are also available:
     * Both Henry and Richard gave talks on FreeS/WAN at the 2000[852]
       Ottawa Linux Symposium.
          + Richard's[853] slides
          + Henry's paper
          + MP3 audio of their talks is available from the[854]
            conference page
     * Moat: A Virtual Private Network Appliances and Services Platform
       is a paper about large-scale (a few 100 links) use of FreeS/WAN in
       a production application at AT&T Research. It is available in
       Postscript or PDF from co-author Steve Bellovin's[855] papers list
       page.
     * One of the Moat co-authors, John Denker, has also written
          + a[856] proposal for how future versions of FreeS/WAN might
            interact with routing protocols
          + a[857] wishlist of possible new features
     * Bart Trojanowski's web page has a draft design for[858] hardware
       acceleration of FreeS/WAN

   Several of these provoked interesting discussions on the mailing
   lists, worth searching for in the[859] archives.

   There are also several papers in languages other than English, see
   our[860] web links.

     _________________________________________________________________

                          Upgrading to FreeS/WAN 2.x

New! Built in Opportunistic connections

   Out of the box, FreeS/WAN 2.x will attempt to encrypt all your IP
   traffic. It will try to establish IPsec connections for:
     * IP traffic from the Linux box on which you have installed
       FreeS/WAN, and
     * outbound IP traffic routed through that Linux box (eg. from a
       protected subnet).

   FreeS/WAN 2.x uses hidden, automatically enabled ipsec.conf
   connections to do this.

   This behaviour is part of our campaign to get Opportunistic Encryption
   (OE) widespread in the Linux world, so that any two Linux boxes can
   encrypt to one another without prearrangement. There's one catch,
   however: you must[887] set up a few DNS records to distribute RSA
   public keys and (if applicable) IPsec gateway information.

   If you start FreeS/WAN before you have set up these DNS records, your
   connectivity will be slow, and messages relating to the built in
   connections will clutter your logs. If you are unable to set up DNS
   for OE, you will wish to[888] disable the hidden connections.

  Upgrading Opportunistic Encryption to 2.01 (or later)

   As of FreeS/WAN 2.01, Opportunistic Encryption (OE) uses DNS TXT
   resource records (RRs) only (rather than TXT with KEY). This change
   causes a "flag day". Users of FreeS/WAN 2.00 (or earlier) OE who are
   upgrading may need to post additional resource records.

   If you are running[889] initiate-only OE, you must put up a TXT record
   in any forward domain as per our[890] quickstart instructions. This
   replaces your old forward KEY.

   If you are running full OE, you require no updates. You already have
   the needed TXT record in the reverse domain. However, to facilitate
   future features, you may also wish to publish that TXT record in a
   forward domain as instructed[891] here.

   If you are running OE on a gateway (and encrypting on behalf of
   subnetted boxes) you require no updates. You already have the required
   TXT record in your gateway's reverse map, and the TXT records for any
   subnetted boxes require no updating. However, to facilitate future
   features, you may wish to publish your gateway's TXT record in a
   forward domain as shown[892] here.

   During the transition, you may wish to leave any old KEY records up
   for some time. They will provide limited backward compatibility.

New! Policy Groups

   We want to make it easy for you to declare security policy as it
   applies to IPsec connections.

   Policy Groups make it simple to say:
     * These are the folks I want to talk to in the clear.
     * These spammers' domains -- I don't want to talk to them at all.
     * To talk to the finance department, I must use IPsec.
     * For any other communication, try to encrypt, but it's okay if we
       can't.

   FreeS/WAN then implements these policies, creating OE connections if
   and when needed. You can use Policy Groups along with connections you
   explicitly define in ipsec.conf.

   For more information, see our[893] Policy Group HOWTO.

New! Packetdefault Connection

   Free/SWAN 2.x ships with the automatically enabled, hidden connection
   packetdefault. This configures a FreeS/WAN box as an OE gateway for
   any hosts located behind it. As mentioned above, you must configure
   some[894] DNS records for OE to work.

   As the name implies, this connection functions as a default. If you
   have more specific connections, such as policy groups which configure
   your FreeS/WAN box as an OE gateway for a local subnet, these will
   apply before packetdefault. You can view packetdefault 's specifics
   in[895] man ipsec.conf .

FreeS/WAN now disables Reverse Path Filtering

   FreeS/WAN often doesn't work with reverse path filtering. At start
   time, FreeS/WAN now turns rp_filter off, and logs a warning.

   FreeS/WAN does not turn it back on again. You can do this yourself
   with a command like:
   echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/eth0/rp_filter

   For eth0, substitute the interface which FreeS/WAN was affecting.

Revised ipsec.conf

  No promise of compatibility

   The FreeS/WAN team promised config-file compatibility throughout the
   1.x series. That means a 1.5 config file can be directly imported into
   a fresh 1.99 install with no problems.

   With FreeS/WAN 2.x, we've given ourselves permission to make the
   config file easier to use. The cost: some FreeS/WAN 1.x configurations
   will not work properly. Many of the new features are, however,
   backward compatible.

  Most ipsec.conf files will work fine

   ... so long as you paste this line, with no preceding whitespace, at
   the top of your config file:
    version 2

  Backward compatibility patch

   If the new defaults bite you, use[896] this ipsec.conf fragment to
   simulate the old default values.

  Details

   We've obsoleted various directives which almost no one was using:
    dump
    plutobackgroundload
    no_eroute_pass
    lifetime
    rekeystart
    rekeytries

   For most of these, there is some other way to elicit the desired
   behaviour. See[897] this post.

   We've made some settings, which almost everyone was using, defaults.
   For example:
    interfaces=%defaultroute
    plutoload=%search
    plutostart=%search
    uniqueids=yes

   We've also changed some default values to help with OE and Policy
   Groups:
    authby=rsasig   ## not secret!!!
    leftrsasigkey=%dnsondemand ## looks up missing keys in DNS when needed.
    rightrsasigkey=%dnsondemand

   Of course, you can still override any defaults by explictly declaring
   something else in your connection.

   [899]Current ipsec.conf manual.

  Upgrading from 1.x RPMs to 2.x RPMs

   Note: When upgrading from 1-series to 2-series RPMs, rpm -U will not
   work.

   You must instead erase the 1.x RPMs, then install the 2.x set:
    rpm -e freeswan
    rpm -e freeswan-module

   On erasing, your old ipsec.conf should be moved to ipsec.conf.rpmsave.
   Keep this. You will probably want to copy your existing connections to
   the end of your new 2.x file.

   Install the RPMs suitable for your kernel version, such as:
    rpm -ivh freeswan-module-2.03_2.4.20_20.9-0.i386.rpm
    rpm -ivh freeswan-userland-2.03_2.4.20_20.9-0.i386.rpm

   Or, to splice the files:
    cat /etc/ipsec.conf /etc/ipsec.conf.rpmsave > /etc/ipsec.conf.tmp
    mv /etc/ipsec.conf.tmp /etc/ipsec.conf

   Then, remove the redundant conn %default and config setup sections.
   Unless you have done any special configuring here, you'll likely want
   to remove the 1.x versions. Remove conn OEself, if present.

                 Quickstart Guide to Opportunistic Encryption

Purpose

   This page will get you started using Linux FreeS/WAN with
   opportunistic encryption (OE). OE enables you to set up IPsec tunnels
   without co-ordinating with another site administrator, and without
   hand configuring each tunnel. If enough sites support OE, a "FAX
   effect" occurs, and many of us can communicate without eavesdroppers.

  OE "flag day"

   As of FreeS/WAN 2.01, OE uses DNS TXT resource records (RRs) only
   (rather than TXT with KEY). This change causes a[900] "flag day".
   Users of FreeS/WAN 2.00 (or earlier) OE who are upgrading may require
   additional resource records, as detailed in our[901] upgrading
   document. OE setup instructions here are for 2.02 or later.

Requirements

   To set up opportunistic encryption, you will need:
     * a Linux box. For OE to the public Internet, this box must NOT be
       behind[902] Network Address Translation (NAT).
     * to install Linux FreeS/WAN 2.02 or later
     * either control over your reverse DNS (for full opportunism) or the
       ability to write to some forward domain (for initiator-only).[903]
       This free DNS service explicitly supports forward TXT records for
       FreeS/WAN use.
     * (for full opportunism) a static IP

   Note: Currently, only Linux FreeS/WAN supports opportunistic
   encryption.

RPM install

   Our instructions are for a recent Red Hat with a 2.4-series stock or
   Red Hat updated kernel. For other ways to install, see our[904]
   install document.

  Download RPMs

   If we have prebuilt RPMs for your Red Hat system, this command will
   get them:
    ncftpget ftp://ftp.xs4all.nl/pub/crypto/freeswan/binaries/RedHat-RPMs/`unam
e -r | tr -d 'a-wy-z'`/\*

   If that fails, you will need to try[905] another install method. Our
   kernel modules will only work on the Red Hat kernel they were built
   for, since they are very sensitive to small changes in the kernel.

   If it succeeds, you will have userland tools, a kernel module, and an
   RPM signing key:
    freeswan-module-2.03_2.4.20_20.9-0.i386.rpm
    freeswan-userland-2.03_2.4.20_20.9-0.i386.rpm
    freeswan-rpmsign.asc

  Check signatures

   If you're running RedHat 8.x or later, import the RPM signing key into
   the RPM database:
    rpm --import freeswan-rpmsign.asc

   For RedHat 7.x systems, you'll need to add it to your[906] PGP
   keyring:
    pgp -ka freeswan-rpmsign.asc

   Check the digital signatures on both RPMs using:
    rpm --checksig freeswan*.rpm

   You should see that these signatures are good:
    freeswan-module-2.03_2.4.20_20.9-0.i386.rpm: pgp md5 OK
    freeswan-userland-2.03_2.4.20_20.9-0.i386.rpm: pgp md5 OK

  Install the RPMs

   Become root:
    su

   Install your RPMs with:

    rpm -ivh freeswan*.rpm

   If you're upgrading from FreeS/WAN 1.x RPMs, and have problems with
   that command, see[907] this note.

   Then, start FreeS/WAN:
    service ipsec start

  Test

   To check that you have a successful install, run:
    ipsec verify

   You should see as part of the verify output:
    Checking your system to see if IPsec got installed and started correctly
    Version check and ipsec on-path                             [OK]
    Checking for KLIPS support in kernel                        [OK]
    Checking for RSA private key (/etc/ipsec.secrets)           [OK]
    Checking that pluto is running                              [OK]
    ...

   If any of these first four checks fails, see our[908] troubleshooting
   guide.

Our Opportunistic Setups

  Full or partial opportunism?

   Determine the best form of opportunism your system can support.
     * For[909] full opportunism, you'll need a static IP and and either
       control over your reverse DNS or an ISP that can add the required
       TXT record for you.
     * If you have a dynamic IP, and/or write access to forward DNS only,
       you can do[910] initiate-only opportunism
     * To protect traffic bound for real IPs behind your gateway,
       use[911] this form of full opportunism.

Initiate-only setup

  Restrictions

   When you set up initiate-only Opportunistic Encryption (iOE):
     * there will be no incoming connection requests; you can initiate
       all the IPsec connections you need.
     * only one machine is visible on your end of the connection.
     * iOE also protects traffic on behalf of[912] NATted hosts behind
       the iOE box.

   You cannot network a group of initiator-only machines if none of these
   is capable of responding to OE. If one is capable of responding, you
   may be able to create a hub topology using routing.

  Create and publish a forward DNS record

    Find a domain you can use

   Find a DNS forward domain (e.g. example.com) where you can publish
   your key. You'll need access to the DNS zone files for that domain.
   This is common for a domain you own. Some free DNS providers, such
   as[913] this one, also provide this service.

   Dynamic IP users take note: the domain where you place your key need
   not be associated with the IP address for your system, or even with
   your system's usual hostname.

    Choose your ID

   Choose a name within that domain which you will use to identify your
   machine. It's convenient if this can be the same as your hostname:
    [root@xy root]# hostname --fqdn
    xy.example.com

   This name in FQDN (fully-qualified domain name) format will be your
   ID, for DNS key lookup and IPsec negotiation.

    Create a forward TXT record

   Generate a forward TXT record containing your system's public key with
   a command like:
    ipsec showhostkey --txt @xy.example.com

   using your chosen ID in place of xy.example.com. This command takes
   the contents of /etc/ipsec.secrets and reformats it into something
   usable by ISC's BIND. The result should look like this (with the key
   data trimmed down for clarity):
    ; RSA 2192 bits   xy.example.com   Thu Jan  2 12:41:44 2003
        IN      TXT     "X-IPsec-Server(10)=@xy.example.com"
    "AQOF8tZ2... ...+buFuFn/"

    Publish the forward TXT record

   Insert the record into DNS, or have a system adminstrator do it for
   you. It may take up to 48 hours for the record to propagate, but it's
   usually much quicker.

  Test that your key has been published

   Check your DNS work
    ipsec verify --host xy.example.com

   As part of the verify output, you ought to see something like:
    ...
    Looking for TXT in forward map: xy.example.com          [OK]
    ...

   For this type of opportunism, only the forward test is relevant; you
   can ignore the tests designed to find reverse records.

  Configure, if necessary

   If your ID is the same as your hostname, you're ready to go. FreeS/WAN
   will use its[914] built-in connections to create your iOE
   functionality.

   If you have chosen a different ID, you must tell FreeS/WAN about it
   via[915] ipsec.conf:
    config setup
        myid=@myname.freedns.example.com

   and restart FreeS/WAN:
    service ipsec restart

   The new ID will be applied to the built-in connections.

   Note: you can create more complex iOE configurations as explained in
   our[916] policy groups document, or disable OE using[917] these
   instructions.

  Test

   That's it![918] Test your connections.

Full Opportunism

   Full opportunism allows you to initiate and receive opportunistic
   connections on your machine.

  Put a TXT record in a Forward Domain

   To set up full opportunism, first[919] set up a forward TXT record as
   for[920] initiator-only OE , using an ID (for example, your hostname)
   that resolves to your IP. Do not configure /etc/ipsec.conf, but
   continue with the instructions for full opportunism, below.

   Note that this forward record is not currently necessary for full OE,
   but will facilitate future features.

  Put a TXT record in Reverse DNS

   You must be able to publish your DNS RR directly in the reverse
   domain. FreeS/WAN will not follow a PTR which appears in the reverse,
   since a second lookup at connection start time is too costly.

    Create a Reverse DNS TXT record

   This record serves to publicize your FreeS/WAN public key. In
   addition, it lets others know that this machine can receive
   opportunistic connections, and asserts that the machine is authorized
   to encrypt on its own behalf.

   Use the command:
    ipsec showhostkey --txt 192.0.2.11

   where you replace 192.0.2.11 with your public IP.

   The record (with key shortened) looks like:
    ; RSA 2048 bits  xy.example.com   Sat Apr 15 13:53:22 2000
    IN TXT  "X-IPsec-Server(10)=192.0.2.11" " AQOF8tZ2...+buFuFn/"

    Publish your TXT record

   Send these records to your ISP, to be published in your IP's reverse
   map. It may take up to 48 hours for these to propagate, but usually
   takes much less time.

  Test your DNS record

   Check your DNS work with
    ipsec verify --host xy.example.com

   As part of the verify output, you ought to see something like:
    ...
    Looking for TXT in reverse map: 11.2.0.192.in-addr.arpa [OK]
    ...

   which indicates that you've passed the reverse-map test.

  No Configuration Needed

   FreeS/WAN 2.x ships with full OE enabled, so you don't need to
   configure anything. To enable OE out of the box, FreeS/WAN 2.x uses
   the policy group private-or-clear, which creates IPsec connections if
   possible (using OE if needed), and allows traffic in the clear
   otherwise. You can create more complex OE configurations as described
   in our[921] policy groups document, or disable OE using[922] these
   instructions .

   If you've previously configured for initiator-only opportunism, remove
   myid= from config setup, so that peer FreeS/WANs will look up your key
   by IP. Restart FreeS/WAN so that your change will take effect, with
    service ipsec restart

  Consider Firewalling

   If you are running a default install of RedHat 8.x, take note: you
   will need to alter your iptables rule setup to allow IPSec traffic
   through your firewall. See[923] our firewall document for sample
   iptables rules.

  Test

   That's it. Now,[924] test your connection.

  Test

   Instructions are in the next section.

Testing opportunistic connections

   Be sure IPsec is running. You can see whether it is with:
    ipsec setup status

   If need be, you can restart it with:
    service ipsec restart

   Load a FreeS/WAN test website from the host on which you're running
   FreeS/WAN. Note: the feds may be watching these sites. Type one of:

   links oetest.freeswan.org
   links oetest.freeswan.nl

   A positive result looks like this:
   You  seem  to  be  connecting  from:  192.0.2.11 which DNS says is:
   gateway.example.com
     _________________________________________________________________

   Status E-route
   OE    enabled    16    192.139.46.73/32    ->    192.0.2.11/32   =>
   tun0x2097@192.0.2.11
   OE    enabled    176    192.139.46.77/32    ->   192.0.2.11/32   =>
   tun0x208a@192.0.2.11

   If you see this, congratulations! Your OE host or gateway will now
   encrypt its own traffic whenever it can. For more OE tests, please see
   our[925] testing document. If you have difficulty, see our[926] OE
   troubleshooting tips.

Now what?

   Please see our[927] policy groups document for more ways to set up
   Opportunistic Encryption.

   You may also wish to make some[928] pre-configured connections.

Notes

     * We assume some facts about your system in order to make
       Opportunistic Encryption easier to configure. For example, we
       assume that you wish to have FreeS/WAN secure your default
       interface.
     * You may change this, and other settings, by altering the config
       setup section in /etc/ipsec.conf.
     * Note that the built-in connections used to build policy groups do
       not inherit from conn default.
     * If you fail to define your local identity and do not fill in your
       reverse DNS entry, you will not be able to use OE.

Troubleshooting OE

   See the OE troubleshooting hints in our[929] troubleshooting guide.

              How to Configure Linux FreeS/WAN with Policy Groups

What are Policy Groups?

   Policy Groups are an elegant general mechanism to configure FreeS/WAN.
   They are useful for many FreeS/WAN users.

   In previous FreeS/WAN versions, you needed to configure each IPsec
   connection explicitly, on both local and remote hosts. This could
   become complex.

   By contrast, Policy Groups allow you to set local IPsec policy for
   lists of remote hosts and networks, simply by listing the hosts and
   networks which you wish to have special treatment in one of several
   Policy Group files. FreeS/WAN then internally creates the connections
   needed to implement each policy.

   In the next section we describe our five Base Policy Groups, which you
   can use to configure IPsec in many useful ways. Later, we will show
   you how to create an IPsec VPN using one line of configuration for
   each remote host or network.

  Built-In Security Options

   FreeS/WAN offers these Base Policy Groups:

   private
          FreeS/WAN only communicates privately with the listed[931] CIDR
          blocks. If needed, FreeS/WAN attempts to create a connection
          opportunistically. If this fails, FreeS/WAN blocks
          communication. Inbound blocking is assumed to be done by the
          firewall. FreeS/WAN offers firewall hooks but no modern
          firewall rules to help with inbound blocking.

   private-or-clear
          FreeS/WAN prefers private communication with the listed CIDR
          blocks. If needed, FreeS/WAN attempts to create a connection
          opportunistically. If this fails, FreeS/WAN allows traffic in
          the clear.

   clear-or-private
          FreeS/WAN communicates cleartext with the listed CIDR blocks,
          but also accepts inbound OE connection requests from them. Also
          known as[932] passive OE (pOE), this policy may be used to
          create an[933] opportunistic responder.

   clear
          FreeS/WAN only communicates cleartext with the listed CIDR
          blocks.

   block
          FreeS/WAN blocks traffic to and from and the listed CIDR
          blocks. Inbound blocking is assumed to be done by the firewall.
          FreeS/WAN offers firewall hooks but no modern firewall rules to
          help with inbound blocking.

   Notes:
     * Base Policy Groups apply to communication with this host only.
     * The most specific rule (whether policy or pre-configured
       connection) applies. This has several practical applications:
          + If CIDR blocks overlap, FreeS/WAN chooses the most specific
            applicable block.
          + This decision also takes into account any pre-configured
            connections you may have.
          + If the most specific connection is a pre-configured
            connection, the following procedure applies. If that
            connection is up, it will be used. If it is routed, it will
            be brought up. If it is added, no action will be taken.
     * Base Policy Groups are created using built-in connections. Details
       in[934] man ipsec.conf.
     * All Policy Groups are bidirectional.[935] This chart shows some
       technical details. FreeS/WAN does not support one-way encryption,
       since it can give users a false sense of security.

Using Policy Groups

   The Base Policy Groups which build IPsec connections rely on
   Opportunistic Encryption. To use the following examples, you must
   first become OE-capable, as described in our[936] quickstart guide.

  Example 1: Using a Base Policy Group

   Simply place CIDR blocks ([937]names, IPs or IP ranges) in
   /etc/ipsec.d/policies/[groupname], and reread the policy group files.

   For example, the private-or-clear policy tells FreeS/WAN to prefer
   encrypted communication to the listed CIDR blocks. Failing that, it
   allows talk in the clear.

   To make this your default policy, place[938] fullnet in the
   private-or-clear policy group file:
    [root@xy root]# cat /etc/ipsec.d/policies/private-or-clear
    # This file defines the set of CIDRs (network/mask-length) to which
    # communication should be private, if possible, but in the clear otherwise.
    ....
    0.0.0.0/0

   and reload your policies with
    ipsec auto --rereadgroups

   Use[939] this test to verify opportunistic connections.

  Example 2: Defining IPsec Security Policy with Groups

   Defining IPsec security policy with Base Policy Groups is like
   creating a shopping list: just put CIDR blocks in the appropriate
   group files. For example:
    [root@xy root]# cd /etc/ipsec.d/policies
    [root@xy policies]# cat private
        192.0.2.96/27              # The finance department
        192.0.2.192/29             # HR
        192.0.2.12                 # HR gateway
        irc.private.example.com    # Private IRC server

    [root@xy policies]# cat private-or-clear
        0.0.0.0/0                  # My default policy: try to encrypt.

    [root@xy policies]# cat clear
        192.0.2.18/32              # My POP3 server
        192.0.2.19/32              # My Web proxy

    [root@xy policies]# cat block
        spamsource.example.com

   To make these settings take effect, type:
    ipsec auto --rereadgroups

   Notes:
     * For opportunistic connection attempts to succeed, all
       participating FreeS/WAN hosts and gateways must be configured for
       OE.
     * Examples 3 through 5 show how to implement a detailed private
       policy.
     * Warning: Using DNS names in policy files and ipsec.conf can be
       tricky. If the name does not resolve, the policy will not be
       implemented for that name. It is therefore safer either to use
       IPs, or to put any critical names in /etc/hosts. We plan to
       implement periodic DNS retry to help with this.
       Names are resolved at FreeS/WAN startup, or when the policies are
       reloaded. Unfortunately, name lookup can hold up the startup
       process. If you have fast DNS servers, the problem may be less
       severe.

  Example 3: Creating a Simple IPsec VPN with the private Group

   You can create an IPsec VPN between several hosts, with only one line
   of configuration per host, using the private policy group.

   First, use our[940] quickstart guide to set up each participating host
   with a FreeS/WAN install and OE.

   In one host's /etc/ipsec.d/policies/private, list the peers to which
   you wish to protect traffic. For example:
    [root@xy root]# cd /etc/ipsec.d/policies
    [root@xy policies]# cat private
        192.0.2.9              # several hosts at example.com
        192.0.2.11
        192.0.2.12
        irc.private.example.com

   Copy the private file to each host. Remove the local host, and add the
   initial host.
    scp2 /etc/ipsec.d/policies/private root@192.0.2.12:/etc/ipsec.d/policies/pr
ivate

   On each host, reread the policy groups with
    ipsec auto --rereadgroups

   That's it! You're configured.

   Test by pinging between two hosts. After a second or two, traffic
   should flow, and
    ipsec eroute

   should yield something like
    192.0.2.11/32   -> 192.0.2.8/32  => tun0x149f@192.0.2.8

   where your host IPs are substituted for 192.0.2.11 and 192.0.2.8.

   If traffic does not flow, there may be an error in your OE setup.
   Revisit our[941] quickstart guide.

   Our next two examples show you how to add subnets to this IPsec VPN.

  Example 4: New Policy Groups to Protect a Subnet

   To protect traffic to a subnet behind your FreeS/WAN gateway, you'll
   need additional DNS records, and new policy groups. To set up the DNS,
   see our[942] quickstart guide. To create five new policy groups for
   your subnet, copy these connections to /etc/ipsec.conf. Substitute
   your subnet's IPs for 192.0.2.128/29.
conn private-net
    also=private  # inherits settings (eg. auto=start) from built in conn
    leftsubnet=192.0.2.128/29  # your subnet's IPs here

conn private-or-clear-net
    also=private-or-clear
    leftsubnet=192.0.2.128/29

conn clear-or-private-net
    also=clear-or-private
    leftsubnet=192.0.2.128/29

conn clear-net
    also=clear
    leftsubnet=192.0.2.128/29

conn block-net
    also=block
    leftsubnet=192.0.2.128/29

   Copy the gateway's files to serve as the initial policy group files
   for the new groups:
    cp -p /etc/ipsec.d/policies/private /etc/ipsec.d/policies/private-net
    cp -p /etc/ipsec.d/policies/private-or-clear /etc/ipsec.d/policies/private-
or-clear-net
    cp -p /etc/ipsec.d/policies/clear-or-private /etc/ipsec.d/policies/clear-or
-private-net
    cp -p /etc/ipsec.d/policies/clear /etc/ipsec.d/policies/clear-net
    cp -p /etc/ipsec.d/policies/block /etc/ipsec.d/policies/block

   Tip: Since a missing policy group file is equivalent to a file with no
   entries, you need only create files for the connections you'll use.

   To test one of your new groups, place the fullnet 0.0.0.0/0 in
   private-or-clear-net. Perform the subnet test in[943] our quickstart
   guide. You should see a connection, and
    ipsec eroute

   should include an entry which mentions the subnet node's IP and the OE
   test site IP, like this:
    192.0.2.131/32   -> 192.139.46.77/32  => tun0x149f@192.0.2.11

  Example 5: Adding a Subnet to the VPN

   Suppose you wish to secure traffic to a subnet 192.0.2.192/29 behind a
   FreeS/WAN box 192.0.2.12.

   First, add DNS entries to configure 192.0.2.12 as an opportunistic
   gateway for that subnet. Instructions are in our[944] quickstart
   guide. Next, create a private-net group on 192.0.2.12 as described
   in[945] Example 4.

   On each other host, add the subnet 192.0.2.192/29 to private ,
   yielding for example
    [root@xy root]# cd /etc/ipsec.d/policies
    [root@xy policies]# cat private
        192.0.2.9              # several hosts at example.com
        192.0.2.11
        192.0.2.12             # HR department gateway
        192.0.2.192/29         # HR subnet
        irc.private.example.com

   and reread policy groups with
    ipsec auto --rereadgroups

   That's all the configuration you need.

   Test your VPN by pinging from a machine on 192.0.2.192/29 to any other
   host:
    [root@192.0.2.194]# ping 192.0.2.11

   After a second or two, traffic should flow, and
    ipsec eroute

   should yield something like
    192.0.2.11/32   -> 192.0.2.194/32  => tun0x149f@192.0.2.12

   Key:

   1. 192.0.2.11/32 Local start point of the protected traffic.
   2. 192.0.2.194/32 Remote end point of the protected traffic.
   3. 192.0.2.12 Remote FreeS/WAN node (gateway or host). May be the same
   as (2).
   4. [not shown] Local FreeS/WAN node (gateway or host), where you've
   produced the output. May be the same as (1).

   For additional assurance, you can verify with a packet sniffer that
   the traffic is being encrypted.

   Note
     * Because strangers may also connect via OE, this type of VPN may
       require a stricter firewalling policy than a conventional VPN.

Appendix

  Our Hidden Connections

   Our Base Policy Groups are created using hidden connections. These are
   spelled out in[946] man ipsec.conf and defined in
   /usr/local/lib/ipsec/_confread.

  Custom Policy Groups

   A policy group is built using a special connection description in
   ipsec.conf, which:
     * is generic. It uses right=[%group|%opportunisticgroup] rather than
       specific IPs. The connection is cloned for every name or IP range
       listed in its Policy Group file.
     * often has a failure rule. This rule, written
       failureshunt=[passthrough|drop|reject|none], tells FreeS/WAN what
       to do with packets for these CIDRs if it fails to establish the
       connection. Default is none.

   To create a new group:
    1. Create its connection definition in ipsec.conf.
    2. Create a Policy Group file in /etc/ipsec.d/policies with the same
       name as your connection.
    3. Put a CIDR block in that file.
    4. Reread groups with ipsec auto --rereadgroups.
    5. Test: ping to activate any OE connection, and view results with
       ipsec eroute.

  Disabling Opportunistic Encryption

   To disable OE (eg. policy groups and packetdefault), cut and paste the
   following lines to /etc/ipsec.conf:
conn block
    auto=ignore

conn private
    auto=ignore

conn private-or-clear
    auto=ignore

conn clear-or-private
    auto=ignore

What is FreeS/WAN?

   FreeS/WAN is a Linux implementation of the[1049] IPsec protocols,
   providing security services at the IP (Internet Protocol) level of the
   network.

   For more detail, see our[1050] introduction document or the FreeS/WAN
   project[1051] web site.

   To start setting it up, go to our[1052] quickstart guide.

   Our[1053] web links document has information on[1054] IPsec for other
   systems.

How do I report a problem or seek help?

   Read our[1055] troubleshooting document.
          It may guide you to a solution. If not, see its[1056] problem
          reporting section.

          Basically, what it says is give us the output from ipsec barf
          from both gateways. Without full information, we cannot
          diagnose a problem. However, ipsec barf produces a lot of
          output. If at all possible, please make barfs accessible via
          the web or FTP rather than sending enormous mail messages.

   Use the[1057] users mailing list for problem reports, rather than
          mailing developers directly.

          + This gives you access to more expertise, including users who
            may have encountered and solved the same problems.
          + It is more likely to get a quick response. Developers may get
            behind on email, or even ignore it entirely for a while, but
            a list message (given a reasonable Subject: line) is certain
            to be read by a fair number of people within hours.
          + It may also be important because of[1058] cryptography export
            laws. A US citizen who provides technical assistance to
            foreign cryptographic work might be charged under the arms
            export regulations. Such a charge would be easier to defend
            if the discussion took place on a public mailing list than if
            it were done in private mail.

   Try irc.freenode.net#freeswan.
          FreeS/WAN developers, volunteers and users can often be found
          there. Be patient and be prepared to provide lots of
          information to support your question.

          If your question was really interesting, and you found an
          answer, please share that with the class by posting to
          the[1059] users mailing list. That way others with the same
          problem can find your answer in the archives.

   Premium support is also available.
          See the next several questions.

Can I get ...

  Can I get an off-the-shelf system that includes FreeS/WAN?

   There are a number of Linux distributions or firewall products which
   include FreeS/WAN. See this[1060] list. Using one of these, chosen to
   match your requirements and budget, may save you considerable time and
   effort.

   If you don't know your requirements, start by reading Schneier's[1061]
   Secrets and Lies. That gives the best overview of security issues I
   have seen. Then consider hiring a consultant (see next question) to
   help define your requirements.

  Can I hire consultants or staff who know FreeS/WAN?

   If you want the help of a contractor, or to hire staff with FreeS/WAN
   expertise, you could:
     * check availability in your area through your local Linux User
       Group ([1062]LUG Index)
     * try asking on our[1063] mailing list

   For companies offerring support, see the next question.

  Can I get commercial support?

   Many of the distributions or firewall products which include FreeS/WAN
   (see this[1064] list) come with commercial support or have it
   available as an option.

   Various companies specialize in commercial support of open source
   software. Our project leader was a founder of the first such company,
   Cygnus Support. It has since been bought by[1065] Redhat. Another such
   firm is[1066] Linuxcare.

Release questions

  What is the current release?

   The current release is the highest-numbered tarball on our[1067]
   distribution site. Almost always, any of[1068] the mirrors will have
   the same file, though perhaps not for a day or so after a release.

   Unfortunately, the web site is not always updated as quickly as it
   should be.

  When is the next release?

   We try to do a release approximately every six to eight weeks.

   If pre-release tests fail and the fix appears complex, or more
   generally if the code does not appear stable when a release is
   scheduled, we will just skip that release.

   For serious bugs, we may bring out an extra bug-fix release. These get
   numbers in the normal release series. For example, there was a bug
   found in FreeS/WAN 1.6, so we did another release less than two weeks
   later. The bug-fix release was called 1.7.

  Are there known bugs in the current release?

   Any problems we are aware of at the time of a release are documented
   in the[1069] BUGS file for that release. You should also look at
   the[1070] CHANGES file.

   Bugs discovered after a release are discussed on the[1071] mailing
   lists. The easiest way to check for any problems in the current code
   would be to peruse the[1072] List In Brief.

Modifications and contributions

  Can I modify FreeS/WAN to ...?

   You are free to modify FreeS/WAN in any way. See the discussion
   of[1073] licensing in our introduction document.

   Before investing much energy in any such project, we suggest that you
     * check the list of[1074] existing patches
     * post something about your project to the[1075] design mailing list

   This may prevent duplicated effort, or lead to interesting
   collaborations.

  Can I contribute to the project?

   In general, we welcome contributions from the community. Various
   contributed patches, either to fix bugs or to add features, have been
   incorporated into our distribution. Other patches, not yet included in
   the distribution, are listed in our[1076] web links section.

   Users have also contributed heavily to documentation, both by creating
   their own[1077] HowTos and by posting things on the[1078] mailing
   lists which I have quoted in these HTML docs.

   There are, however, some caveats.

   FreeS/WAN is being implemented in Canada, by Canadians, largely to
   ensure that is it is entirely free of export restrictions. See
   this[1079] discussion. We cannot accept code contributions from US
   residents or citizens, not even one-line bugs fixes. The reasons for
   this were recently discussed extensively on the mailing list, in a
   thread starting[1080] here.

   Not all contributions are of interest to us. The project has a set of
   fairly ambitious and quite specific goals, described in our[1081]
   introduction. Contributions that lead toward these goals are likely to
   be welcomed enthusiastically. Other contributions may be seen as lower
   priority, or even as a distraction.

   Discussion of possible contributions takes place on the[1082] design
   mailing list.

  Is there detailed design documentation?

   There are:
     * [1083]RFCs specifying the protocols we implement
     * [1084]man pages for our utilities, library functions and file
       formats
     * comments in the source code
     * [1085]HTML documentation written primarily for users
     * archived discussions from the[1086] mailing lists
     * other papers mentioned in our[1087] introduction

   The only formal design documents are a few papers in the last category
   above. All the other categories, however, have things to say about
   design as well.

Will FreeS/WAN work in my environment?

  Can FreeS/WAN talk to ...?

   The IPsec protocols are designed to support interoperation. In theory,
   any two IPsec implementations should be able to talk to each other. In
   practice, it is considerably more complex. We have a whole[1088]
   interoperation document devoted to this problem.

   An important part of that document is links to the many[1089]
   user-written HowTos on interoperation between FreeS/WAN and various
   other implementations. Often the users know more than the developers
   about these issues (and almost always more than me :-), so these
   documents may be your best resource.

  Can different FreeS/WAN versions talk to each other?

   Linux FreeS/WAN can interoperate with many IPsec implementations,
   including earlier versions of Linux FreeS/WAN itself.

   In a few cases, there are some complications. See our[1090]
   interoperation document for details.

  Is there a limit on throughput?

   There is no hard limit, but see below.

  Is there a limit on number of tunnels?

   There is no hard limit, but see next question.

  Is a ... fast enough to handle FreeS/WAN with my loads?

   A quick summary:

   Even a limited machine can be useful
          A 486 can handle a T1, ADSL or cable link, though the machine
          may be breathing hard.

   A mid-range PC (say 800 MHz with good network cards) can do a lot of
          IPsec
          With up to roughly 50 tunnels and aggregate bandwidth of 20
          Megabits per second, it willl have cycles left over for other
          tasks.

   There are limits
          Even a high end CPU will not come close to handling a fully
          loaded 100 Mbit/second Ethernet link.

          Beyond about 50 tunnels it needs careful management.

   See our[1091] FreeS/WAN performance document for details.

Will FreeS/WAN work on ... ?

  Will FreeS/WAN run on my version of Linux?

   We build and test on Redhat distributions, but FreeS/WAN runs just
   fine on several other distributions, sometimes with minor fiddles to
   adapt to the local environment. Details are in our[1092] compatibility
   document. Also, some distributions or products come with[1093]
   FreeS/WAN included.

  Will FreeS/WAN run on non-Intel CPUs?

   FreeS/WAN is intended to run on all CPUs Linux supports . We know of
   it being used in production on x86, ARM, Alpha and MIPS. It has also
   had successful tests on PPC and SPARC, though we don't know of actual
   use there. Details are in our[1094] compatibility document.

  Will FreeS/WAN run on multiprocessors?

   FreeS/WAN is designed to work on any SMP architecture Linux supports,
   and has been tested successfully on at least dual processor Intel
   architecture machines. Details are in our[1095] compatibility
   document.

  Will FreeS/WAN work on an older kernel?

   It might, but we strongly recommend using a recent 2.2 or 2.4 series
   kernel. Sometimes the newer versions include security fixes which can
   be quite important on a gateway.

   Also, we use recent kernels for development and testing, so those are
   better tested and, if you do encounter a problem, more easily
   supported. If something breaks applying recent FreeS/WAN patches to an
   older kernel, then "update your kernel" is almost certain to be the
   first thing we suggest. It may be the only suggestion we have.

   The precise kernel versions supported by a particular FreeS/WAN
   release are given in the[1096] README file of that release.

   See the following question for more on kernels.

  Will FreeS/WAN run on the latest kernel version?

   Sometimes yes, but quite often, no.

   Kernel versions supported are given in the[1097] README file of each
   FreeS/WAN release. Typically, they are whatever production kernels
   were current at the time of our release (or shortly before; we might
   release for kernel n just as Linus releases n+1 ). Often FreeS/WAN
   will work on slightly later kernels as well, but of course this cannot
   be guaranteed.

   For example, FreeS/WAN 1.91 was released for kernels 2.2.19 or 2.4.5,
   the current kernels at the time. It also worked on 2.4.6, 2.4.7 and
   2.4.8, but 2.4.9 had changes that caused compilation errors if it was
   patched with FreeS/WAN 1.91.

   When such changes appear, we put a fix in the FreeS/WAN snapshots, and
   distribute it with our next release. However, this is not a high
   priority for us, and it may take anything from a few days to several
   weeks for such a problem to find its way to the top of our kernel
   programmer's To-Do list. In the meanwhile, you have two choices:
     * either stick with a slightly older kernel, even if it is not the
       latest and greatest. This is recommended for production systems;
       new versions may have new bugs.
     * or fix the problem yourself and send us a patch, via the[1098]
       Users mailing list.

   We don't even try to keep up with kernel changes outside the main 2.2
   and 2.4 branches, such as the 2.4.x-ac patched versions from Alan Cox
   or the 2.5 series of development kernels. We'd rather work on
   developing the FreeS/WAN code than on chasing these moving targets. We
   are, however, happy to get patches for problems discovered there.

   See also the[1099] Choosing a kernel section of our installation
   document.

  Will FreeS/WAN work on unusual network hardware?

   IPsec is designed to work over any network that IP works over, and
   FreeS/WAN is intended to work over any network interface hardware that
   Linux supports.

   If you have working IP on some unusual interface -- perhaps Arcnet,
   Token Ring, ATM or Gigabit Ethernet -- then IPsec should "just work".

   That said, practice is sometimes less tractable than theory. Our
   testing is done almost entirely on:
     * 10 or 100 Mbit Ethernet
     * ADSL or cable connections, with and without PPPoE
     * IEEE 802.11 wireless LANs (see[1100] below)

   If you have some other interface, especially an uncommon one, it is
   entirely possible you will get bitten either by a FreeS/WAN bug which
   our testing did not turn up, or by a bug in the driver that shows up
   only with our loads.

   If IP works on your interface and FreeS/WAN doesn't, seek help on
   the[1101] mailing lists.

   Another FAQ section describes[1102] MTU problems . These are a
   possibility for some interfaces.

  Will FreeS/WAN work on a VLAN (802.1q) network?

   Yes, FreeSwan works fine, though some network drivers have problems
   with jumbo sized ethernet frames. If you used interfaces=%defaultroute
   you do not need to change anything, but if you specified an interface
   (eg eth0) then remember you must change that to reflect the VLAN
   interface (eg eth0.2 for VLAN ID 2).

   The "eepro100" module is known to be broken, use the e100 driver for
   those cards instead (included in 2.4 as 'alternative driver' for the
   Intel EtherExpressPro/100.

   You do not need to change any MTU setting (those are workarounds that
   are only needed for buggy drivers)

   This FAQ contributed by Paul Wouters.

Does FreeS/WAN support ...

   For a discussion of which parts of the IPsec specifications FreeS/WAN
   does and does not implement, see our[1103] compatibility document.

   For information on some often-requested features, see below.

  Does FreeS/WAN support site-to-site VPN ([1104] Virtual Private Network)
  applications?

   Absolutely. See this FreeS/WAN-FreeS/WAN[1105] configuration example.
   If only one site is using FreeS/WAN, there may be a relevant HOWTO on
   our[1106] interop page.

  Does FreeS/WAN support remote users connecting to a LAN?

   Yes. We call the remote users "Road Warriors". Check out our
   FreeS/WAN-FreeS/WAN[1107] Road Warrior Configuration Example.

   If your Road Warrior is a Windows or Mac PC, you may need to install
   an IPsec implementation on that machine. Our[1108] interop page lists
   many available brands, and features links to several HOWTOs.

  Does FreeS/WAN support remote users using shared secret authentication?

   Yes, but there are severe restrictions, so we strongly recommend
   using[1109] RSA keys for[1110] authentication instead.

   See this[1111] FAQ question.

  Does FreeS/WAN support wireless networks?

   Yes, it is a common practice to use IPsec over wireless networks
   because their built-in encryption,[1112] WEP, is insecure.

   There is some[1113] discussion in our advanced configuration document.
   See also the[1114] WaveSEC site.

  Does FreeS/WAN support X.509 or other PKI certificates?

   Vanilla FreeS/WAN does not support X.509, but Andreas Steffen and
   others have provided a popular, well-supported X.509 patch.
     * [1115]patch
     * [1116]Super FreeS/WAN incorporates this and other user-contributed
       patches.
     * Kai Martius'[1117] X.509 Installation and Configuration Guide

   Linux FreeS/WAN features[1118] Opportunistic Encryption, an
   alternative Public Key Infrastructure based on Secure DNS.

  Does FreeS/WAN support user authentication (Radius, SecureID, Smart Card...)?

   Andreas Steffen's[1119] X.509 patch (v. 1.42+) supports Smart Cards.
   The patch does not ship with vanilla FreeS/WAN, but will be
   incorporated into[1120] Super FreeS/WAN 2.01+. The patch implements
   the PCKS#15 Cryptographic Token Information Format Standard, using the
   OpenSC smartcard library functions.

   Older news:

   A user-supported patch to FreeS/WAN 1.3, for smart card style
   authentication, is available on[1121] Bastiaan's site. It supports
   skeyid and ibutton. This patch is not part of Super FreeS/WAN.

   For a while progress on this front was impeded by a lack of standard.
   The IETF[1122] working group has now nearly completed its recommended
   solution to the problem; meanwhile several vendors have implemented
   various things.

   Of course, there are various ways to avoid any requirement for user
   authentication in IPsec. Consider the situation where road warriors
   build IPsec tunnels to your office net and you are considering
   requiring user authentication during tunnel negotiation. Alternatives
   include:
     * If you can trust the road warrior machines, then set them up so
       that only authorised users can create tunnels. If your road
       warriors use laptops, consider the possibility of theft.
     * If the tunnel only provides access to particular servers and you
       can trust those servers, then set the servers up to require user
       authentication.

   If either of those is trustworthy, it is not clear that you need user
   authentication in IPsec.

  Does FreeS/WAN support NAT traversal?

   Vanilla FreeS/WAN does not, but thanks to Mathieu Lafon and Arkoon
   Network Security, there's a patch to support this.
     * [1123]patch and documentation
     * [1124]Super FreeS/WAN incorporates this and other user-contributed
       patches.

   The NAT traversal patch has some issues with PSKs, so you may wish to
   authenticate with RSA keys, or X.509 (requires a patch which is also
   included in Super FreeS/WAN). Doing the latter also has advantages
   when dealing with large numbers of clients who may be behind NAT;
   instead of having to make an individual Roadwarrior connection for
   each virtual IP, you can use the "rightsubnetwithin" parameter to
   specify a range. See[1125] these rightsubnetwithin instructions.

  Does FreeS/WAN support assigning a "virtual identity" to a remote system?

   Some IPsec implementations allow you to make the source address on
   packets sent by a Road Warrior machine be something other than the
   address of its interface to the Internet. This is sometimes described
   as assigning a virtual identity to that machine.

   FreeS/WAN does not directly support this, but it can be done. See
   this[1126] FAQ question.

  Does FreeS/WAN support single DES encryption?

   No, single DES is not used either at the[1127] IKE level for
   negotiating connections or at the[1128] IPsec level for actually
   building them.

   Single DES is[1129] insecure. As we see it, it is more important to
   deliver real security than to comply with a standard which has been
   subverted into allowing use of inadequate methods. See this[1130]
   discussion.

   If you want to interoperate with an IPsec implementation which offers
   only DES, see our[1131] interoperation document.

  Does FreeS/WAN support AES encryption?

   [1132]AES is a new US government[1133] block cipher standard to
   replace the obsolete[1134] DES.

   At time of writing (March 2002), the FreeS/WAN distribution does not
   yet support AES but user-written[1135] patches are available to add
   it. Our kernel programmer is working on integrating those patches into
   the distribution, and there is active discussion of this on the design
   mailimg list.

  Does FreeS/WAN support other encryption algorithms?

   Currently[1136] triple DES is the only cipher supported. AES will
   almost certainly be added (see previous question), and it is likely
   that in the process we will also add the other two AES finalists with
   open licensing, Twofish and Serpent.

   We are extremely reluctant to add other ciphers. This would make both
   use and maintenance of FreeS/WAN more complex without providing any
   clear benefit. Complexity is emphatically not desirable in a security
   product.

   Various users have written patches to add other ciphers. We
   provide[1137] links to these.

Can I ...

  Can I use policy groups along with explicitly configured connections?

   Yes, you can, so long as you pay attention to the selection rule,
   which can be summarized "the most specific connection wins". We
   describe the rule in our[1138] policy groups document, and provide a
   more technical explanation in[1139] man ipsec.conf.

   A good guideline: If you have a regular connection defined in
   ipsec.conf, ensure that a subset of that connection is not listed in a
   less restrictive policy group. Otherwise, FreeS/WAN will use the
   subset, with its more specific source/destination pair.

   Here's an example. Suppose you are the system administrator at
   192.0.2.2. You have this connection in ipsec.conf: ipsec.conf :
conn net-to-net
    left=192.0.2.2           # you are here
    right=192.0.2.8
    rightsubnet=192.0.2.96/27
    ....

   If you then place a host or net within rightsubnet, (let's say
   192.0.2.98) in private-or-clear, you may find that 192.0.2.2 at times
   communicates in the clear with 192.0.2.98. That's consistent with the
   rule, but may be contrary to your expectations.

   On the other hand, it's safe to put a larger subnet in a less
   restrictive policy group file. If private-or-clear contains
   192.0.2.0/24, then the more specific net-to-net connection is used for
   any communication to 192.0.2.96/27. The more general policy applies
   only to communication with hosts or subnets in 192.0.2.0/24 without a
   more specific policy or connection.

  Can I turn off policy groups?

   Yes. Use[1140] these instructions.

  Can I reload connection info without restarting?

   Yes, you can do this. Here are the details, in a mailing list message
   from Pluto programmer Hugh Redelmeier:
| How can I reload config's without restarting all of pluto and klips?  I am us
ing

There may be more bits to look for, depending on what you are trying

   Another useful command here is ipsec auto --replace <conn_name> which
   re-reads data for a named connection.

  Can I use several masqueraded subnets?

   Yes. This is done all the time. See the discussion in our[1141] setup
   document. The only restriction is that the subnets on the two ends
   must not overlap. See the next question.

   Here is a mailing list message on the topic. The user incorrectly
   thinks you need a 2.4 kernel for this -- actually various people have
   been doing it on 2.0 and 2.2 for quite some time -- but he has it

Subject: Double NAT and freeswan working :)
   Date: Sun, 11 Mar 2001
   From: Paul Wouters <paul@xtdnet.nl>

Just to share my pleasure, and make an entry for people who are searching
the net on how to do this. Here's the very simple solution to have a double
NAT'ed network working with freeswan. (Not sure if this is old news, but I'm
not on the list (too much spam) and I didn't read this in any HOWTO/FAQ/doc
on the freeswan site yet (Sandy, put it in! :)

10.0.0.0/24 --- 10.0.0.1 a.b.c.d  ---- a.b.c.e {internet} ----+
                                                              |
10.0.1.0/24 --- 10.0.1.1 f.g.h.i  ---- f.g.h.j {internet} ----+

the goal is to have the first network do a VPN to the second one, yet also
have NAT in place for connections not destinated for the other side of the
NAT. Here the two Linux security gateways have one real IP number (cable
modem, dialup, whatever.

The problem with NAT is you don't want packets from 10.*.*.* to 10.*.*.*
to be NAT'ed. While with Linux 2.2, you can't, with Linux 2.4 you can.

(This has been tested and works for 2.4.2 with Freeswan snapshot2001mar8b)

relevant parts of /etc/ipsec.conf:

        left=f.g.h.i
        leftsubnet=10.0.1.0/24
        leftnexthop=f.g.h.j
        leftfirewall=yes
        leftid=@firewall.netone.nl
        leftrsasigkey=0x0........
        right=a.b.c.d
        rightsubnet=10.0.0.0/24
        rightnexthop=a.b.c.e
        rightfirewall=yes
        rightid=@firewall.nettwo.nl
        rightrsasigkey=0x0......
        # To authorize this connection, but not actually start it, at startup,
        # uncomment this.
        auto=add

and now the real trick. Setup the NAT correctly on both sites:

iptables -t nat -F
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -d \! 10.0.0.0/8 -j MASQUERADE

This tells the NAT code to only do NAT for packets with destination other then
10.* networks. note the backslash to mask the exclamation mark to protect it
against the shell.

Happy painting :)

  Can I use subnets masqueraded to the same addresses?

   No. The notion that IP addresses are unique is one of the fundamental
   principles of the IP protocol. Messing with it is exceedingly
   perilous.

   Fairly often a situation comes up where a company has several
   branches, all using the same[1142] non-routable addresses, perhaps
   192.168.0.0/24. This works fine as long as those nets are kept
   distinct. The[1143] IP masquerading on their firewalls ensures that
   packets reaching the Internet carry the firewall address, not the
   private address.

   This can break down when IPsec enters the picture. FreeS/WAN builds a
   tunnel that pokes through both masquerades and delivers packets from
   leftsubnet to rightsubnet and vice versa. For this to work, the two
   subnets must be distinct.

   There are several solutions to this problem.

   Usually, you re-number the subnets. Perhaps the Vancouver office
   becomes 192.168.101.0/24, Calgary 192.168.102.0/24 and so on.
   FreeS/WAN can happily handle this. With, for example
   leftsubnet=192.168.101.0/24 and rightsubnet=192.168.102.0/24 in a
   connection description, any machine in Calgary can talk to any machine
   in Vancouver. If you want to be more restrictive and use something
   like leftsubnet=192.168.101.128/25 and rightsubnet=192.168.102.240/28
   so only certain machines on each end have access to the tunnel, that's
   fine too.

   You could also split the subnet into smaller ones, for example using
   192.168.1.0/25 in Vancouver and rightsubnet=192.168.0.128/25 in
   Calgary.

   Alternately, you can just give up routing directly to machines on the
   subnets. Omit the leftsubnet and rightsubnet parameters from your
   connection descriptions. Your IPsec tunnels will then run between the
   public interfaces of the two firewalls. Packets will be masqueraded
   both before they are put into tunnels and after they emerge. Your
   Vancouver client machines will see only one Calgary machine, the
   firewall.

  Can I assign a road warrior an address on my net (a virtual identity)?

   Often it would be convenient to be able to give a Road Warrior an IP
   address which appears to be on the local network. Some IPsec
   implementations have support for this, sometimes calling the feature
   "virtual identity".

   Currently (Sept 2002) FreeS/WAN does not support this, and we have no
   definite plans to add it. The difficulty is that is not yet a standard
   mechanism for it. There is an Internet Draft for a method of doing it
   using[1144] DHCP which looks promising. FreeS/WAN may support that in
   a future release.

   In the meanwhile, you can do it yourself using the Linux iproute2(8)
   facilities. Details are in[1145] this paper.

   Another method has also been discussed on the mailing list.:
     * You can use a variant of the[1146] extruded subnet procedure.
     * You have to avoid having the road warrior's assigned address
       within the range you actually use at home base. See previous
       question.
     * On the other hand, you want the roadwarrior's address to be within
       the range that seems to be on your network.

   For example, you might have:

   leftsubnet=a.b.c.0/25
          head office network

   rightsubnet=a.b.c.129/32
          extruded to a road warrior. Note that this is not in a.b.c.0/25

   a.b.c.0/24
          whole network, including both the above

   You then set up routing so that the office machines use the IPsec
   gateway as their route to a.b.c.128/25. The leftsubnet parameter tells
   the road warriors to use tunnels to reach a.b.c.0/25, so you should
   have two-way communication. Depending or your network and
   applications, there may be some additional work to do on DNS or
   Windows configuration

  Can I support many road warriors with one gateway?

   Yes. This is easily done, using

   either RSA authentication
          standard in the FreeS/WAN distribution

   or X.509 certificates
          requires[1147] Super FreeS/WAN or a patch.

   In either case, each Road Warrior must have a different key or
   certificate.

   It is also possible using pre-shared key authentication, though we
   don't recommend this; see the[1148] next question for details.

   If you expect to have more than a few dozen Road Warriors connecting
   simultaneously, you may need a fairly powerful gateway machine. See
   our document on[1149] FreeS/WAN performance.

  Can I have many road warriors using shared secret authentication?

   Yes, but avoid it if possible.

   You can have multiple Road Warriors using shared secret authentication
   only if they all use the same secret. You must also set:

   uniqueids=no

   in the connection definition.

   Why it's less secure:
     * If you have many users, it becomes almost certain the secret will
       leak
     * The secret becomes quite valuable to an attacker
     * All users authenticate the same way, so the gateway cannot tell
       them apart for logging or access control purposes
     * Changing the secret is difficult. You have to securely notify all
       users.
     * If you find out the secret has been compromised, you can change
       it, but then what? None of your users can connect without the new
       secret. How will you notify them all, quickly and securely,
       without using the VPN?

   This is a designed-in limitation of the[1150] IKE key negotiation
   protocol, not a problem with our implementation.

   We very strongly recommend that you avoid using shared secret
   authentication for multiple Road Warriors. Use RSA authentication
   instead.

   The longer story: When using shared secrets, the protocol requires
   that the responding gateway be able to determine which secret to use
   at a time when all it knows about the initiator is an IP address. This
   works fine if you know the initiator's address in advance and can use
   it to look up the appropiriate secret. However, it fails for Road
   Warriors since the gateway cannot know their IP addresses in advance.

   With RSA signatures (or certificates) the protocol is slightly
   different. The initiator provides an identifier early in the exchange
   and the responder can use that identifier to look up the correct key
   or certificate. See[1151] above.

  Can I use Quality of Service routing with FreeS/WAN?

   From project technical lead Henry Spencer:
> Do QoS add to FreeS/WAN?
> For example integrating DiffServ and FreeS/WAN?

With a current version of FreeS/WAN, you will have to add hidetos=no to
the config-setup section of your configuration file.  By default, the TOS
field of tunnel packets is zeroed; with hidetos=no, it is copied from the
packet inside.  (This is a modest security hole, which is why it is no
longer the default.)

DiffServ does not interact well with tunneling in general.  Ways of
improving this are being studied.

   Copying the[1152] TOS (type of service) information from the
   encapsulated packet to the outer header reveals the TOS information to
   an eavesdropper. This does not tell him much, but it might be of use
   in[1153] traffic analysis. Since we do not have to give it to him, our
   default is not to.

   Even with the TOS hidden, you can still:
     * apply QOS rules to the tunneled (ESP) packets; for example, by
       giving ESP packets a certain priority.
     * apply QOS rules to the packets as they enter or exit the tunnel
       via an IPsec virtual interface (eg. ipsec0).

   See[1154] ipsec.conf(5) for more on the hidetos= parameter.

  Can I recognise dead tunnels and shut them down?

   There is no general mechanism to do this is in the IPsec protocols.

   From time to time, there is discussion on the IETF Working Group[1155]
   mailing list of adding a "keep-alive" mechanism (which some say should
   be called "make-dead"), but it is a fairly complex problem and no
   consensus has been reached on whether or how it should be done.

   The protocol does have optional[1156] delete-SA messages which one
   side can send when it closes a connection in hopes this will cause the
   other side to do the same. FreeS/WAN does not currently support these.
   In any case, they would not solve the problem since:
     * a gateway that crashes or hangs would not send the messages
     * the sender is not required to send them
     * they are not authenticated, so any receiver that trusts them
       leaves itself open to a[1157] denial of service attack
     * the receiver is not required to do anything about them
     * the receiver cannot acknowledge them; the protocol provides no
       mechanism for that
     * since they are not acknowledged, the sender cannot rely on them

   However, connections do have limited lifetimes and you can control how
   many attempts your gateway makes to rekey before giving up. For
   example, you can set:
conn default
        keyingtries=3
        keylife=30m

   With these settings old connections will be cleaned up. Within 30
   minutes of the other end dying, rekeying will be attempted. If it
   succeeds, the new connection replaces the old one. If it fails, no new
   connection is created. Either way, the old connection is taken down
   when its lifetime expires.

   Here is a mailing list message on the topic from FreeS/WAN tech
   support person Claudia Schmeing:
You ask how to determine whether a tunnel is redundant:

> Can anybody explain the best way to determine this. Esp when a RW has
> disconnected? I thought 'ipsec auto --status' might be one way.

If a tunnel goes down from one end, Linux FreeS/WAN on the
other end has no way of knowing this until it attempts to rekey.
Once it tries to rekey and fails, it will 'know' that the tunnel is
down.

Because it doesn't have a way of knowing the state until this point,
it will also not be able to tell you the state via ipsec auto --status.

> However, comparing output from a working tunnel with that of one that
> was closed
> did not show clearly show tunnel status.

If your tunnel is down but not 'unrouted' (see man ipsec_auto), you
should not be able to ping the opposite side of the tunnel. You can
use this as an indicator of tunnel status.

On a related note, you may be interested to know that as of 1.7,
redundant tunnels caused by RW disconnections are likely to be
less of a pain. From doc/CHANGES:

    There is a new configuration parameter, uniqueids, to control a new Pluto
    option:  when a new connection is negotiated with the same ID as an old
    one, the old one is deleted immediately.  This should help eliminate
    dangling Road Warrior connections when the same Road Warrior reconnects.
    It thus requires that IDs not be shared by hosts (a previously legal but
    probably useless capability).  NOTE WELL:  the sample ipsec.conf now has
    uniqueids=yes in its config-setup section.


Cheers,

Claudia

  Can I build IPsec tunnels over a demand-dialed link?

   This is possible, but not easy. FreeS/WAN technical lead Henry Spencer
   wrote:

This one is awkward to solve.  If the real interface that the IPsec
interface is mounted on goes down, it takes most of the IPsec machinery
down with it, and a restart is the only good way to recover.

The only really clean fix, right now, is to split the machines in two:

1. A minimal machine serves as the network router, and only it is aware
that the link goes up and down.

2. The IPsec is done on a separate gateway machine, which thinks it has
a permanent network connection, via the router.

This is clumsy but it does work.  Trying to do both functions within a
single machine is tricky.  There is a software package (diald) which will
give the illusion of a permanent connection for demand-dialed modem
connections; I don't know whether it's usable for ISDN, or whether it can
be made to cooperate properly with FreeS/WAN.

Doing a restart each time the interface comes up *does* work, although it
is a bit painful.  I did that with PPP when I was running on a modem link;
it wasn't hard to arrange the PPP scripts to bring IPsec up and down at
the right times.  (I'd meant to investigate diald but never found time.)

In principle you don't need to do a complete restart on reconnect, but you
do have to rebuild some things, and we have no nice clean way of doing
only the necessary parts.

On my laptop, when using ppp there is a ip-up script in /etc/ppp that
will be executed each time that the ppp interface is brought up.
Likewise there is an ip-down script that is called when it is taken
down.  You might consider custimzing those to stop and start FreeS/WAN
with each connection.  I believe that ISDN uses the same files, though
I could be wrong---there should be something similar though.

  Can I build GRE, L2TP or PPTP tunnels over IPsec?

   Yes. Normally this is not necessary, but it is useful in a few special
   cases. For example, if you must route non-IP packets such as IPX, you
   will need to use a tunneling protocol that can route these packets.
   IPsec can be layered around it for extra security. Another example:
   you can provide failover protection for high availability (HA)
   environments by combining IPsec with other tools. Ken Bantoft
   describes one such setup in[1158] Using FreeS/WAN with Linux-HA, GRE,
   OSPF and BGP for enterprise grade VPN solutions.

   GRE over IPsec is covered as part of[1159] that document.[1160] Here
   are links to other GRE resources. Jacco de Leuw has created[1161] this
   page on L2TP over IPsec with instructions for FreeS/WAN and several
   other brands of IPsec software.

   Please let us know of other useful links via the[1162] mailing lists.

  ... use Network Neighborhood (Samba, NetBIOS) over IPsec?

   Your local PC needs to know how to translate NetBIOS names to IP
   addresses. It may do this either via a local LMHOSTS file, or using a
   local or remote WINS server. The WINS server is preferable since it
   provides a centralized source of the information to the entire
   network. To use a WINS server over the[1163] VPN (or any IP-based
   network), you must enable "NetBIOS over TCP".

   [1164]Samba can emulate a WINS server on Linux.

Life's little mysteries

   FreeS/WAN is a fairly complex product. (Neither the networks it runs
   on nor the protocols it uses are simple, so it could hardly be
   otherwise.) It therefore sometimes exhibits behaviour which can be
   somewhat confusing, or has problems which are not easy to diagnose.
   This section tries to explain those problems.

   Setup and configuration of FreeS/WAN are covered in other
   documentation sections:
     * [1166]basic setup and configuration
     * [1167]advanced configuration
     * [1168]Troubleshooting

   However, we also list some of the commonest problems here.

  I cannot ping ....

   This question is dealt with in the advanced configuration section
   under the heading[1169] multiple tunnels.

   The standard subnet-to-subnet tunnel protects traffic only between the
   subnets. To test it, you must use pings that go from one subnet to the
   other.

   For example, suppose you have:
      subnet a.b.c.0/24
             |
      eth1 = a.b.c.1
         gate1
      eth0 = 192.0.2.8
             |

       ~ internet ~

             |
      eth0 = 192.0.2.11
         gate2
      eth1 = x.y.z.1
              |
       subnet x.y.z.0/24

   and the connection description:
conn abc-xyz
     left=192.0.2.8
     leftsubnet=a.b.c.0/24
     right=192.0.2.11
     rightsubnet=x.y.z.0/24

   You can test this connection description only by sending a ping that
   will actually go through the tunnel. Assuming you have machines at
   addresses a.b.c.2 and x.y.z.2, pings you might consider trying are:

   ping from x.y.z.2 to a.b.c.2 or vice versa
          Succeeds if tunnel is working. This is the only valid test of
          the tunnel.

   ping from gate2 to a.b.c.2 or vice versa
          Does not use tunnel. gate2 is not on protected subnet.

   ping from gate1 to x.y.z.2 or vice versa
          Does not use tunnel. gate1 is not on protected subnet.

   ping from gate1 to gate2 or vice versa
          Does not use tunnel. Neither gate is on a protected subnet.

   Only the first of these is a useful test of this tunnel. The others do
   not use the tunnel. Depending on other details of your setup and
   routing, they:
     * either fail, telling you nothing about the tunnel
     * or succeed, telling you nothing about the tunnel since these
       packets use some other route

   In some cases, you may be able to get around this. For the example
   network above, you could use:
        ping -I a.b.c.1 x.y.z.1

   Both the adresses given are within protected subnets, so this should
   go through the tunnel.

   If required, you can build additional tunnels so that all the machines
   involved can talk to all the others. See[1170] multiple tunnels in the
   advanced configuration document for details.

  It takes forever to ...

   Users fairly often report various problems involving long delays,
   sometimes on tunnel setup and sometimes on operations done through the
   tunnel, occasionally on simple things like ping or more often on more
   complex operations like doing NFS or Samba through the tunnel.

   Almost always, these turn out to involve failure of a DNS lookup. The
   timeouts waiting for DNS are typically set long so that you won't time
   out when a query involves multiple lookups or long paths. Genuine
   failures therefore produce long delays before they are detected.

   A mailing list message from project technical lead Henry Spencer:
> ... when i run /etc/rc.d/init.d/ipsec start, i get:
> ipsec_setup: Starting FreeS/WAN IPsec 1.5...
> and it just sits there, doesn't give back my bash prompt.

Almost certainly, the problem is that you're using DNS names in your
ipsec.conf, but DNS lookups are not working for some reason.  You will
get your prompt back... eventually.  But the DNS timeouts are long.
Doing something about this is on our list, but it is not easy.

   In the meanwhile, we recommend that connection descriptions in[1171]
   ipsec.conf(5) use numeric IP addresses rather than names which will
   require a DNS lookup.

   Names that do not require a lookup are fine. For example:
     * a road warrior might use the identity
       rightid=@lancelot.example.org
     * the gateway might use leftid=@camelot.example.org

   These are fine. The @ sign prevents any DNS lookup. However, do not
   attempt to give the gateway address as left=camelot.example.org . That
   requires a lookup.

   A post from one user after solving a problem with long delays:
Subject: Final Answer to Delay!!!
   Date: Mon, 19 Feb 2001
   From: "Felippe Solutions" <felippe@solutionstecnologia.com.br>

Sorry people, but seems like the Delay problem had nothing to do with
freeswan.

The problem was DNS as some people sad from the beginning, but not the way
they thought it was happening. Samba, ssh, telnet and other apps try to
reverse lookup addresses when you use IP numbers (Stupid that ahh).

I could ping very fast because I always ping with "-n" option, but I don't
know the option on the other apps to stop reverse addressing so I don't use
it.

   This post is fairly typical. These problems are often tricky and
   frustrating to diagnose, and most turn out to be DNS-related.

   One suggestion for diagnosis: test with both names and addresses if
   possible. For example, try all of:
     * ping address
     * ping -n address
     * ping name

   If these behave differently, the problem must be DNS-related since the
   three commands do exactly the same thing except for DNS lookups.

  I send packets to the tunnel with route(8) but they vanish

   IPsec connections are designed to carry only packets travelling
   between pre-defined connection endpoints. As project technical lead
   Henry Spencer put it:

     IPsec tunnels are not just virtual wires; they are virtual wires
     with built-in access controls. Negotiation of an IPsec tunnel
     includes negotiation of access rights for it, which don't include
     packets to/from other IP addresses. (The protocols themselves are
     quite inflexible about this, so there are limits to what we can do
     about it.)

   For fairly obvious security reasons, and to comply with the IPsec
   RFCs,[1172] KLIPS drops any packets it receives that are not allowed
   on the tunnels currently defined. So if you send it packets with
   route(8), and suitable tunnels are not defined, the packets vanish.
   Whether this is reported in the logs depends on the setting of
   klipsdebug in your[1173] ipsec.conf(5) file.

   To rescue vanishing packets, you must ensure that suitable tunnels for
   them exist, by editing the connection descriptions in[1174]
   ipsec.conf(5). For example, supposing you have a simple setup:
         leftsubnet -- leftgateway === internet === roadwarrior

   If you want to give the roadwarrior access to some resource that is
   located behind the left gateway but is not in the currently defined
   left subnet, then the usual procedure is to define an additional
   tunnel for those packets by creating a new connection description.

   In some cases, it may be easier to alter an existing connection
   description, enlarging the definition of leftsubnet. For example,
   instead of two connection descriptions with 192.168.8.0/24 and
   192.168.9.0/24 as their leftsubnet parameters, you can use a single
   description with 192.168.8.0/23.

   If you have multiple endpoints on each side, you need to ensure that
   there is a route for each pair of endpoints. See this[1175] example.

  When a tunnel goes down, packets vanish

   This is a special case of the vanishing packet problem described in
   the previous question. Whenever KLIPS sees packets for which it does
   not have a tunnel, it drops them.

   When a tunnel goes away, either because negotiations with the other
   gateway failed or because you gave an ipsec auto --down command, the
   route to its other end is left pointing into KLIPS, and KLIPS will
   drop packets it has no tunnel for.

   This is a documented design decision, not a bug. FreeS/WAN must not
   automatically adjust things to send packets via another route. The
   other route might be insecure.

   Of course, re-routing may be necessary in many cases. In those cases,
   you have to do it manually or via scripts. We provide the ipsec auto
   --unroute command for these cases.

   From[1176] ipsec_auto(8):

     Normally, pluto establishes a route to the destination specified
     for a connection as part of the --up operation. However, the route
     and only the route can be established with the --route operation.
     Until and unless an actual connection is established, this discards
     any packets sent there, which may be preferable to having them sent
     elsewhere based on a more general route (e.g., a default route).

     Normally, pluto's route to a destination remains in place when a
     --down operation is used to take the connection down (or if
     connection setup, or later automatic rekeying, fails). This permits
     establishing a new connection (perhaps using a different
     specification; the route is altered as necessary) without having a
     ``window'' in which packets might go elsewhere based on a more
     general route. Such a route can be removed using the --unroute
     operation (and is implicitly removed by --delete).

   See also this mailing list[1177] message.

  The firewall ate my packets!

   If firewalls filter out:
     * either the UDP port 500 packets used in IKE negotiations
     * or the ESP and AH (protocols 50 and 51) packets used to implement
       the IPsec tunnel

   then IPsec cannot work. The first thing to check if packets seem to be
   vanishing is the firewall rules on the two gateway machines and any
   other machines along the path that you have access to.

   For details, see our document on[1178] firewalls .

   Some advice from technical lead Henry Spencer on diagnosing such
   problems:
> > Packets vanishing between the hardware interface and the ipsecN interface

>

The other thing to check is whether the "RX packets dropped" count on the
ipsecN interface (run "ifconfig ipsecN", for N=1 or whatever, to see the
counts) is rising.  If so, then there's some sort of configuration mismatch
between the two ends, and IPsec itself is rejecting them.  If none of the
ipsecN counts is rising, then the packets are never reaching the IPsec
machinery, and the problem is almost certainly in firewalls etc.

  Dropped connections

   Networks being what they are, IPsec connections can be broken for any
   number of reasons, ranging from hardware failures to various software
   problems such as the path MTU problems discussed[1179] elsewhere in
   the FAQ. Fortunately, various diagnostic tools exist that help you
   sort out many of the possible problems.

   There is one situation, however, where FreeS/WAN (using default
   settings) may destroy a connection for no readily apparent reason.
   This occurs when things are misconfigured so that two tunnels from the
   same gateway expect the same subnet on the far end.

   In this situation, the first tunnel comes up fine and works until the
   second is established. At that point, because of the way we track
   connections internally, the first tunnel ceases to exist as far as
   this gateway is concerned. Of course the far end does not know that,
   and a storm of error messages appears on both systems as it tries to
   use the tunnel.

   If the far end gives up, goes back to square one and negotiates a new
   tunnel, then that wipes out the second tunnel and ...

   The solution is simple. Do not build multiple conn descriptions with
   the same remote subnet.

   This is actually intended to be a feature, rather than a bug. Consider
   the situation where a single remote system goes down, then comes back
   up and reconnects to the gateway. It is useful to have the gateway
   tear down the old tunnel and recover resources when the reconnection
   is made. It recognises that situation by checking the remote subnet
   for each tunnel it builds and discarding duplicates. This works fine
   as long as you don't configure multiple tunnels with the same remote
   subnet.

   If this behaviour is inconvenient for you, you can disable it by
   setting uniqueids=no in[1180] ipsec.conf(5).

  Disappearing %defaultroute

   When an underlying connection (eg. ppp) goes down, FreeS/WAN will not
   recover properly without a little help. Here are the symptoms that
   FreeS/WAN user Michael Carmody noticed:
> After about 24 hours the freeswan connection takes over the default route.

   If you're using a FreeS/WAN 2.x/KLIPS system, simply re-attach the
   IPsec virtual interface with ipsec tnconfig command such as:
    ipsec tnconfig --attach --virtual ipsec0 --physical ppp0

   In your command, name the physical and virtual interfaces as they
   appear paired on your system during regular uptime. For a system with
   several physical/virtual interface pairs on flaky links, you'll need
   more than one such command. If you're using FreeS/WAN 1.x, you must
   restart FreeS/WAN, which is more time consuming.

   [1181]Here is a script which can help to automate the process of
   FreeS/WAN restart at need. It could easily be adapted to use tnconfig
   instead.

  TCPdump on the gateway shows strange things

   As another user pointed out, keeping the connect

   Attempting to look at IPsec packets by running monitoring tools on the
   IPsec gateway machine can produce silly results. That machine is
   mangling the packets for IPsec, and possibly for firewall or NAT
   purposes as well. If the internals of the machine's IP stack are not
   what the monitoring tool expects, then the tool can misinterpret them
   and produce nonsense output.

   See our[1182] testing document for more detail.

  Traceroute does not show anything between the gateways

   As far as traceroute can see, the two gateways are one hop apart; the
   data packet goes directly from one to the other through the tunnel. Of
   course the outer packets that implement the tunnel pass through
   whatever lies between the gateways, but those packets are built and
   dismantled by the gateways. Traceroute does not see them and cannot
   report anything about their path.

Claudia got this exactly right.  Let me just expand on a couple of points:

*) GateB is exactly one (virtual) hop away from GateA.  This is how it
would be if there were a physically private wire from A to B.  The
virtually private connection should work the same, and it does.

*) While the information is in transit from GateA to GateB, the hop count
of the outer header (the "envelope") is being decremented.  The hop count
of the inner header (the "contents" of the envelope) is not decremented and
should not be decremented.  The hop count of the outer header is not
derived from and should not be derived from the hop count of the inner header.

Indeed, even if the packets did time out in transit along the tunnel, there
would be no way for traceroute to find out what happened.  Just as
information cannot leak _out_ of the tunnel to the outside, information
cannot leak _into_ the tunnel from outside, and this includes ICMP messages
from routers along the path.

There are some cases where one might wish for information about what is
happening at the IP layer (below the tunnel layer) -- but the protocol
makes no provision for this.  This raises all sorts of conceptual issues.
AFAIK nobody has ever cared enough to really figure out what _should_
happen, let alone implement it and standardize it.

*) I consider the "* * *" to be a slight bug.  One might wish for it to be
replaced by "GateB GateB GateB".  It has to do with treating host-to-subnet
traffic different from subnet-to-subnet traffic (and other gory details).
I fervently hope KLIPS2 will make this problem go away.

*) If you want to ask questions about the link from GateA to GateB at the
IP level (below the tunnel level), you have to ssh to GateA and launch a
traceroute from there.

Testing in stages

   It is often useful in debugging to test things one at a time:
     * disable IPsec entirely, for example by turning it off with
       chkconfig(8), and make sure routing works
     * Once that works, try a manually keyed connection. This does not
       require key negotiation between Pluto and the key daemon on the
       other end.
     * Once that works, try automatically keyed connections
     * Once IPsec works, add packet compression
     * Once everything seems to work, try stress tests with large
       transfers, many connections, frequent re-keying, ...

   FreeS/WAN releases are tested for all of these, so you can be
   reasonably certain they can do them all. Of course, that does not mean
   they will on the first try, especially if you have some unusual
   configuration.

   The rest of this section gives information on diagnosing the problem
   when each of the above steps fails.

  Manually keyed connections don't work

   Suspect one of:
     * mis-configuration of IPsec system in the /etc/ipsec.conf file
       common errors are incorrect interface or next hop information
     * mis-configuration of manual connection in the /etc/ipsec.conf file
     * routing problems causing IPsec packets to be lost
     * bugs in KLIPS
     * mismatch between the transforms we support and those another IPsec
       implementation offers.

  One manual connection works, but second one fails

   This is a fairly common problem when attempting to configure multiple
   manually keyed connections from a single gateway.

   Each connection must be identified by a unique[1183] SPI value. For
   automatic connections, these values are assigned automatically. For
   manual connections, you must set them with spi= statements in[1184]
   ipsec.conf(5).

   Each manual connection must have a unique SPI value in the range 0x100
   to 0x999. Two or more with the same value will fail. For details, see
   our doc section[1185] Using manual keying in production and the man
   page[1186] ipsec.conf(5).

  Manual connections work, but automatic keying doesn't

   The most common reason for this behaviour is a firewall dropping the
   UDP port 500 packets used in key negotiation.

   Other possibilities:
     * mis-configuration of auto connection in the /etc/ipsec.conf file.
       One common configuration error is forgetting that you need
       auto=add to load the connection description on the receiving end
       so it recognises the connection when the other end asks for it.
     * error in shared secret in /etc/ipsec.secrets
     * one gateway lacks a route to the other so Pluto's UDP packets are
       lost
     * bugs in Pluto
     * incompatibilities between Pluto's[1187] IKE implementation and the
       IKE at the other end of the tunnel.
       Some possibile problems are discussed in out[1188] interoperation
       document.

  IPsec works, but connections using compression fail

   When we first added compression, we saw some problems:
     * compatibility issues with other implementations. We followed the
       RFCs and omitted some extra material that many compression
       libraries add by default. Some other implementations left the
       extras in
     * bugs in assembler compression routines on non-Intel CPUs. The
       workaround is to use C code instead of possibly problematic
       assembler.

   We have not seen either problem in some time (at least six months as I
   write in March 2002), but if you have some unusual configuration then
   you may see them.

  Small packets work, but large transfers fail

   If tests with ping(1) and a small packet size succeed, but tests or
   transfers with larger packet sizes fail, suspect problems with packet
   fragmentation and perhaps[1189] path MTU discovery.

   Our[1190] troubleshooting document covers these problems. Information
   on the underlying mechanism is in our[1191] background document.

  Subnet-to-subnet works, but tests from the gateways don't

   This is described under[1192] I cannot ping... above.

Compilation problems

  gmp.h: No such file or directory

   Pluto needs the GMP (GNU

   Multi-Precision) library for the large integer calculations it uses
   in[1193] public key cryptography. This error message indicates a

   compile.

   The GMP library is included in most Linux distributions. Typically,
   there are two RPMs, libgmp and libgmp-devel, You need to install both,
   either from your distribution CDs or from your vendor's web site.

   On Debian, a mailing list message reports that the command to give is
   apt-get install gmp2.

I'm seeing exactly the same problem on an Ultra with 256MB ram and 500
MB swap.  Except I am compiling version 1.5 and its Red Hat 6.2.

I can get around this by using -O instead of -O2 for the optimization
level.  So it is probably a bug in the optimizer on the sparc complier.
I'll try and chase this down on the sparc lists.

Interpreting error messages

  route-client (or host) exited with status 7

   list tech support person) Claudia Schmeing. The "FAQ on the network
   unreachable error" which she refers to is the next question below.

In general, if the FAQ doesn't cover it, you can search the mailing list
archives - I like to use
http://www.sandelman.ottawa.on.ca/linux-ipsec/
but you can see doc/mail.html for different archive formats.


Your error comes from the _updown script, which performs some
routing and firewall functions to help Linux FreeS/WAN. More info
is available at doc/firewall.html and man ipsec.conf. Its routing
is integral to the health of Linux FreeS/WAN; it also provides facility
to insert custom firewall rules to be executed when you create or destroy
a connection.

Yours is, of course, a routing error. You can be fairly sure the routing
machinery is saying "network is unreachable". There's a FAQ on the
"network is unreachable" error, but more information is available now; read on.

If your _updown script is recent (for example if it shipped with
Linux FreeS/WAN 1.91), you will see another debugging line in your logs
that looks something like this:

> output: /usr/local/lib/ipsec/_updown: `route add -net 128.174.253.83
> netmask 255.255.255.255 dev ipsec0 gw 66.92.93.161' failed

This is, of course, the system route command that exited with status 7,
(ie. failed). Man route for details. Seeing the command typed out yields
more information. If your _updown script is older, you may wish to update
it to show the command explicitly.

Three parameters fed to the route command: net, netmask and gw [gateway]
are derived from things you've put in ipsec.conf.

Net and netmask are derived from the peer's IP and mask. In more detail:

You may see a routing error when routing to a client (ie. subnet), or
to a host (IPSec gateway or freestanding host; a box that does IPSec for
itself). In _updown, the "route-client" section  is responsible to set up
the route for IPSec'd (usually, read 'tunneled') packets headed to a
peer subnet. Similarly, route-host routes IPSec'd packets to a peer host
or IPSec gateway.

When routing to a 'client', net and netmask are ipsec.conf's left- or
rightsubnet (whichever is not local). Similarly, when routing to a
'host' the net is left or right. Host netmask is always /32, indicating a
single machine.

Gw is nexthop's value. Again, the value in question is left- or rightnexthop,
whichever is local. Where left/right or left-/rightnexthop has the special
value %defaultroute (described in man ipsec.conf), gw will automagically get
the value of the next hop on the default route.

Q: "What's a nexthop and why do I need one?"

A: 'nexthop' is a routing kluge; its value is the next hop away
   from the machine that's doing IPSec, and toward your IPSec peer.
   You need it to get the processed packets out of the local system and
   onto the wire. While we often route other packets through the machine
   that's now doing IPSec, and are done with it, this does not suffice here.
   After packets are processed with IPSec, this machine needs to know where
   they go next. Of course using the 'IPSec gateway' as their routing gateway
   would cause an infinite loop! [To visualize this, see the packet flow
   diagram at doc/firewall.html.] To avoid this, we route packets through
   the next hop down their projected path.

Now that you know the background, consider:
1. Did you test routing between the gateways in the absence of Linux
   FreeS/WAN, as recommended? You need to ensure the two machines that
   will be running Linux FreeS/WAN can route to one another before trying to
   make a secure connection.
2. Is there anything obviously wrong with the sense of your route command?

Normally, this problem is caused by an incorrect local nexthop parameter.
Check out the use of %defaultroute, described in man ipsec.conf. This is
a simple way to set nexthop for most people. To figure nexthop out by hand,
traceroute in-the-clear to your IPSec peer. Nexthop is the traceroute's
first hop after your IPSec gateway.

  SIOCADDRT:Network is unreachable

   This message is not from FreeS/WAN, but from the Linux IP stack
   itself. That stack is seeing packets it has no route for, either
   because your routing was broken before FreeS/WAN started or because
   FreeS/WAN's changes broke it.

   Here is a message from Claudia suggesting ways to diagnose and fix
   such problems:
You write,
> I have correctly installed freeswan-1.8 on RH7.0 kernel 2.2.17, but when
> I setup a VPN connection with the other machine(RH5.2 Kernel 2.0.36
> freeswan-1.0, it works well.) it told me that

Often this error is the result of a misconfiguration.

Be sure that you can route successfully in the absence of Linux
FreeS/WAN. (You say this is no problem, so proceed to the next step.)

Use a custom copy of the default updownscript. Do not change the route
commands, but add a diagnostic message revealing the exact text of the
route command. Is there a problem with the sense of the route command
that you can see? If so, then re-examine those ipsec.conf settings
that are being sent to the route command.

You may wish to use the ipsec auto --route and --unroute commands to
troubleshoot the problem. See man ipsec_auto for details.

   Since the above message was written, we have modified the updown
   script to provide a better diagnostic for this problem. Check
   /var/log/messages.

   status 7.

  ipsec_setup: modprobe: Can't locate module ipsec

  ipsec_setup: Fatal error, kernel appears to lack KLIPS

   These messages indicate an installation failure. The kernel you are
   running does not contain the[1196] KLIPS (kernel IPsec) code.

   Note that the "modprobe: Can't locate module ipsec" message appears
   even if you are not using modules. If there is no KLIPS in your
   kernel, FreeS/WAN tries to load it as a module. If that fails, you get
   this message.

   Commands you can quickly try are:

   uname -a
          to get details, including compilation date and time, of the
          currently running kernel

   ls /
   ls /boot
          to ensure a new kernel is where it should be. If kernel
          compilation puts it in / but lilo wants it in /boot , then you

Yes, because the Pluto (daemon) part of ipsec is installed correctly, but
as we see below the kernel portion is not.

This is your problem. You have not successfully installed a kernel with
IPSec machinery in it.

Did you build Linux FreeS/WAN as a module? If so, you need to ensure that
your new module has been installed in the directory where your kernel
loader normally finds your modules. If not, you need to ensure
that the new IPSec-enabled kernel is being loaded correctly.

See also doc/install.html, and INSTALL in the distro.

  ipsec_setup: ... failure to fetch key for ... from DNS

   Quoting Henry:
Note that by default, FreeS/WAN is now set up to
     (a) authenticate with RSA keys, and
     (b) fetch the public key of the far end from DNS.
Explicit attention to  ipsec.conf will be needed if you want
to do something different.

   and Claudia, responding to the same user:
You write,

Valid values for authby= are rsasig and secret, which entail authentication
by RSA signature or by shared secret, respectively. Because you have
commented authby=rsasig out, you are using the default value of authby=secret.

When using RSA signatures, there are two ways to get the public key for the
IPSec peer: either copy it directly into *rsasigkey= in ipsec.conf, or
fetch it from dns. The magic value %dns for *rsasigkey parameters says to
try to fetch the peer's key from dns.

For any parameters, you may find their significance and special values in
man ipsec.conf. If you are setting up keys or secrets, be sure also to
reference man ipsec.secrets.

  ipsec_setup: ... interfaces ... and ... share address ...

   This is a fatal error. FreeS/WAN cannot cope with two or more
   interfaces using the same IP address. You must re-configure to avoid
   this.

   A mailing list message on the topic from Pluto developer Hugh
   Redelmeier:

Pluto won't touch an interface that shares an IP address with another.
This will eventually change, but it probably won't happen soon.

For now, you will have to give the ppp1 and ppp2 different addresses.

  ipsec_setup: Cannot adjust kernel flags

   A mailing list message form technical lead Henry Spencer:

I think that directory is a 2.2ism, although I'm not certain (I don't have
a 2.0.xx system handy any more for testing).  Without it, some of the
ipsec.conf config-setup flags won't work, but otherwise things should
function.

   You also need to enable the /proc filesystem in your kernel
   configuration for these operations to work.

  Message numbers (MI3, QR1, et cetera) in Pluto messages

   Pluto messages often indicate where Pluto is in the IKE protocols. The
   letters indicate Main mode or Q uick mode and Initiator or Responder.
   The numerals are message sequence numbers. For more detail, see

  Connection names in Pluto error messages

   From Pluto programmer Hugh Redelmeier:
| Jan 17 16:21:10 remus Pluto[13631]: "jumble" #1: responding to Main Mode from
 Road Warrior 130.205.82.46
| Jan 17 16:21:11 remus Pluto[13631]: "jumble" #1: no suitable connection for p
eer @banshee.wittsend.com
|
|     The connection "jumble" has nothing to do with the incoming
| connection requests, which were meant for the connection "banshee".

You are right.  The message tells you which Connection Pluto is
currently using, which need not be the right one.  It need not be the
right one now for the negotiation to eventually succeed!  This is
described in ipsec_pluto(8) in the section "Road Warrior Support".

There are two times when Pluto will consider switching Connections for
a state object.  Both are in response to receiving ID payloads (one in
Phase 1 / Main Mode and one in Phase 2 / Quick Mode).  The second is
not unique to Road Warriors.  In fact, neither is the first any more
(two connections for the same pair of hosts could differ in Phase 1 ID
payload; probably nobody else has tried this).

  Pluto: ... can't orient connection

   Older versions of FreeS/WAN used this message. The same error now
   gives the "we have no ipsecN ..." error described just below.

  ... we have no ipsecN interface for either end of this connection

   Your tunnel has no IP address which matches the IP address of any of
   the available IPsec interfaces. Either you've misconfigured the
   connection, or you need to define an appropriate IPsec interface
   connection. interfaces=%defaultroute works in many cases.

   A longer story: Pluto needs to know whether it is running on the
   machine which the connection description calls left or on right. It
   figures that out by:
     * looking at the interfaces given in interfaces= lines in the config
       setup section
     * discovering the IP addresses for those interfaces
     * searching for a match between those addresses and the ones given
       in left= or right= lines.

   Normally a match is found. Then Pluto knows where it is and can set up
   other things (for example, if it is left) using parameters such as
   leftsubnet and leftnexthop, and sending its outgoing packets to right.

   If no match is found, it emits the above error message.

  Pluto: ... no connection is known

   This error message occurs when a remote system attempts to negotiate a
   connection and Pluto does not have a connection description that
   matches what the remote system has requested. The most common cause is
   a configuration error on one end or the other.

   Parameters involved in this match are left, right , leftsubnet and
   rightsubnet.

   The match must be exact. For example, if your left subnet is
   a.b.c.0/24 then neither a single machine in that net nor a smaller
   subnet such as a.b.c.64/26 will be considered a match.

   The message can also occur when an appropriate description exists but
   Pluto has not loaded it. Use an auto=add statement in the connection
   description, or an ipsec auto --add <conn_name> command, to correct
   this.

   An explanation from the Pluto developer:
| Jul 12 15:00:22 sohar58 Pluto[574]: "corp_road" #2: cannot respond to IPsec
| SA request because no connection is known for
| 216.112.83.112/32===216.112.83.112...216.67.25.118

This is the first message from the Pluto log showing a problem.  It
means that PGPnet is trying to negotiate a set of SAs with this
topology:

216.112.83.112/32===216.112.83.112...216.67.25.118
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
client on our side  our host         PGPnet host, no client

None of the conns you showed look like this.

Use
        ipsec auto --status
to see a snapshot of what connections are in pluto, what
negotiations are going on, and what SAs are established.

The leftsubnet= (client) in your conn is 216.112.83.64/26.  It must
exactly match what pluto is looking for, and it does not.

  Pluto: ... no suitable connection ...

   This is similar to the[1199] no connection known error, but occurs at
   a different point in Pluto processing.

   Here is one of Claudia's messages explaining the problem:
You write,

> What could be the reason of the following error?
> "no suitable connection for peer '@xforce'"

When a connection is initiated by the peer, Pluto must choose which entry in
the conf file best matches the incoming connection. A preliminary choice is
made on the basis of source and destination IPs, since that information is
available at that time.

A payload containing an ID arrives later in the negotiation. Based on this
id and the *id= parameters, Pluto refines its conn selection. ...

The message "no suitable connection" indicates that in this refining step,
Pluto does not find a connection that matches that ID.

Please see "Selecting a connection when responding" in man ipsec_pluto for
more details.

   See also[1200] Connection names in Pluto error messages.

  Pluto: ... no connection has been authorized

   Here is one of Claudia's messages discussing this problem:
You write,

>  May 22 10:46:31 debian Pluto[25834]: packet from x.y.z.p:10014:
>  initial Main Mode message from x.y.z.p:10014
                            but no connection has been authorized

This error occurs early in the connection negotiation process,
at the first step of IKE negotiation (Main Mode), which is itself the
first of two negotiation phases involved in creating an IPSec connection.

Here, Linux FreeS/WAN receives a packet from a potential peer, which
requests that they begin discussing a connection.

The "no connection has been authorized" means that there is no connection
description in Linux FreeS/WAN's internal database that can be used to
link your ipsec interface with that peer.

"But of course I configured that connection!"

It may be that the appropriate connection description exists in ipsec.conf
but has not been added to the database with ipsec auto --add myconn or the
auto=add method. Or, the connection description may be misconfigured.

The only parameters that are relevant in this decision are left= and right= .
Local and remote ports are also taken into account -- we see that the port
is printed in the message above -- but there is no way to control these
in ipsec.conf.


Failure at "no connection has been authorized" is similar to the
"no connection is known for..." error in the FAQ, and the "no suitable
connection" error described in the snapshot's FAQ. In all three cases,
Linux FreeS/WAN is trying to match parameters received in the
negotiation with the connection description in the local config file.

As it receives more information, its matches take more parameters into
account, and become more precise:  first the pair of potential peers,
then the peer IDs, then the endpoints (including any subnets).

The "no suitable connection for peer *" occurs toward the end of IKE
(Main Mode) negotiation, when the IDs are matched.

"no connection is known for a/b===c...d" is seen at the beginning of IPSec
(Quick Mode, phase 2) negotiation, when the connections are matched using
left, right, and any information about the subnets.

  Pluto: ... OAKLEY_DES_CBC is not supported.

   This message occurs when the other system attempts to negotiate a
   connection using[1201] single DES, which we do not support because it
   is[1202] insecure.

   Our interoperation document has suggestions for[1203] how to deal with
   systems that attempt to use single DES.

  Pluto: ... no acceptable transform

   This message means that the other gateway has made a proposal for
   connection parameters, but nothing they proposed is acceptable to
   Pluto. Possible causes include:
     * misconfiguration on either end
     * policy incompatibilities, for example we require encrypted
       connections but they are trying to create one with just
       authentication
     * interoperation problems, for example they offer only single DES
       and FreeS/WAN does not support that. See[1204] discussion in our
       interoperation document.

   A more detailed explanation, from Pluto programmer Hugh Redelmeier:
Background:

When one IKE system (for example, Pluto) is negotiating with another
to create an SA, the Initiator proposes a bunch of choices and the
Responder replies with one that it has selected.

The structure of the choices is fairly complicated.  An SA payload
contains a list of lists of "Proposals".  The outer list is a set of
choices: the selection must be from one element of this list.

Each of these elements is a list of Proposals.  A selection must be
made from each of the elements of the inner list.  In other words,
*all* of them apply (that is how, for example, both AH and ESP can
apply at once).

Within each of these Proposals is a list of Transforms.  For each
Proposal selected, one Transform must be selected (in other words,
each Proposal provides a choice of Transforms).

Each Transform is made up of a list of Attributes describing, well,
attributes.  Such as lifetime of the SA.  Such as algorithm to be
used.  All the Attributes apply to a Transform.

You will have noticed a pattern here: layers alternate between being
disjunctions ("or") and conjunctions ("and").

For Phase 1 / Main Mode (negotiating an ISAKMP SA), this structure is
cut back.  There must be exactly one Proposal.  So this degenerates to
a list of Transforms, one of which must be chosen.

In your case, no proposal was considered acceptable to Pluto (the
Responder).  So negotiation ceased.  Pluto logs the reason it rejects
each Transform.  So look back in the log to see what is going wrong.

*That* is a neon sign flashing "GMP LIBRARY IS BROKEN".  Rsasigkey calls
GMP a lot, and our own library a little bit, and that's very nearly all it
does.  Barring bugs in its code or our library -- which have happened, but

   See the next question for how to deal with GMP errors.

   Pluto has died. Signal 4 is SIGILL, illegal instruction.

   The most likely cause is that your[1205] GMP (GNU multi-precision)
   library is compiled for a different processor than what you are
   running on. Pluto uses that library for its public key calculations.

   Try getting the GMP sources and recompile for your processor type.
   Most Linux distributions will include this source, or you can download
   it from the[1206] GMP home page.

  ECONNREFUSED error message

   From John Denker, on the mailing list:
1)  The log message
  some IKE message we sent has been rejected with

2) Minor suggestion for further improvement: it might be worth mentioning
that the command
  tcpdump -i eth1 icmp[0] != 8 and icmp[0] != 0
is useful for tracking down the details in question.  We shouldn't expect
all IPsec users to figure that out on their own.  The log message might
even provide a hint as to where to look in the docs.

   This message means[1207] KLIPS has received a packet for which no

In general, more information is required so that people on the list may
give you informed input. See doc/prob.report.

   The document she refers to has since been replaced by a[1208] section
   of the troubleshooting document.
However, I can make some general comments on this type of error.

This error usually looks something like this (clipped from an archived

What does this mean?
- --------------------

"eroute" stands for "extended route", and is a special type of route
internal to Linux FreeS/WAN. For more information about this type of route,
see the section of man ipsec_auto on ipsec auto --route.

"no eroute!" here means, roughly, that Linux FreeS/WAN cannot find an
appropriate tunnel that should have delivered this packet. Linux
FreeS/WAN therefore drops the packet, with the message "no eroute! ...
dropping", on the assumption that this packet is not a legitimate
transmission through a properly constructed tunnel.


How does this situation come about?
- -----------------------------------

Linux FreeS/WAN has a number of connection descriptions defined in
ipsec.conf. These must be successfully brought "up" to form actual tunnels.
(see doc/setup.html's step 15, man ipsec.conf and man ipsec_auto
for details).

Such connections are often specific to the endpoints' IPs. However, in
some cases they may be more general, for example in the case of
Road Warriors where left or right is the special value %any.

When Linux FreeS/WAN receives a packet, it verifies that the packet has
come through a legitimate channel, by checking that there is an
appropriate tunnel through which this packet might legitimately have
arrived. This is the process we see above.

First, it checks for an eroute that exactly matches the packet. In the
example above, we see it checking for a route that begins at 192.168.1.2
and ends at 192.168.100.1. This search favours the most specific match that
would apply to the route between these IPs. So, if there is a connection
description exactly matching these IPs, the search will end there. If not,
the code will search for a more general description matching the IPs.
If there is no match, either specific or general, the packet will be
dropped, as we see, above.

Unless you are working with Road Warriors, only the first, specific part
of the matching process is likely to be relevant to you.


"But I defined the tunnel, and it came up, why do I have this error?"
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------

One of the most common causes of this error is failure to specify enough
connection descriptions to cover all needed tunnels between any two
gateways and their respective subnets. As you have noticed, troubleshooting
this error may be complicated by the use of IP Masq. However, this error is
not limited to cases where IP Masq is used.

See doc/configuration.html#multitunnel for a detailed example of the
solution to this type of problem.

   The documentation section she refers to is now[1209] here.

  ... trouble writing to /dev/ipsec ... SA already in use

   This error message occurs when two manual connections are set up with

   See the FAQ for[1210] One manual connection works, but second one

  ... ignoring ... payload

   This message is harmless. The IKE protocol provides for a number of
   optional messages types:
     * delete SA
     * initial contact
     * vendor ID
     * ...

   An implementation is never required to send these, but they are
   allowed to. The receiver is not required to do anything with them.
   FreeS/WAN ignores them, but notifies you via the logs.

   For the "ignoring delete SA Payload" message, see also our discussion
   of cleaning up[1211] dead tunnels.

   This message can appear when you've upgraded an X.509-enabled Linux

   or add the[1213] X.509 patch by hand.

Why don't you restrict the mailing lists to reduce spam?

   As a matter of policy, some of our[1214] mailing lists need to be open
   to non-subscribers. Project management feel strongly that maintaining
   this openness is more important than blocking spam.
     * Users should be able to get help or report bugs without
       subscribing.
     * Even a user who is subscribed may not have access to his or her
       subscribed account when he or she needs help, miles from home base
       in the middle of setting up a client's gateway.
     * There is arguably a legal requirement for this policy. A US
       resident or citizen could be charged under munitions export laws
       for providing technical assistance to a foreign cryptographic
       project. Such a charge would be more easily defended if the
       discussion takes place in public, on an open list.

   This has been discussed several times at some length on the list. See
   the[1215] list archives. Bringing the topic up again is unlikely to be
   useful. Please don't. Or at the very least, please don't without
   reading the archives and being certain that whatever you are about to
   suggest has not yet been discussed.

   Project technical lead Henry Spencer summarised one discussion:

     For the third and last time: this list *will* *not* do
     address-based filtering. This is a policy decision, not an
     implementation problem. The decision is final, and is not open to
     discussion. This needs to be communicated better to people, and
     steps are being taken to do that.

   Adding this FAQ section is one of the steps he refers to.

   You have various options other than just putting up with the spam,
   filtering it yourself, or unsubscribing:
     * subscribe only to one or both of our lists with restricted posting
       rules:
          + [1216]briefs , weekly list summaries
          + [1217]announce , project-related announcements
     * read the other lists via the[1218] archives

   A number of tools are available to filter mail.
     * Many mail readers include some filtering capability.
     * Many Linux distributions include[1219] procmail(8) for server-side
       filtering.
     * The[1220] Spam Bouncer is a set of procmail(8) filters designed to
       combat spam.
     * Roaring Penguin have a[1221] MIME defanger that removes
       potentially dangerous attachments.

   If you use your ISP's mail server rather than running your own,
   consider suggesting to the ISP that they tag suspected spam as[1222]
   this ISP does. They could just refuse mail from dubious sources, but
   that is tricky and runs some risk of losing valuable mail or
   senselessly annoying senders and their admins. However, they can
   safely tag and deliver dubious mail. The tags can greatly assist your
   filtering.

Once again:  for legal reasons, it is important that discussions of these
things be held in a public place -- the list -- and we do not want to
force people to subscribe to the list just to ask one question, because
that may be more than merely inconvenient for them.  There are also real
difficulties with people who are temporarily forced to use alternate
addresses; that is precisely the time when they may be most in need of
help, yet a subscribers-only policy shuts them out.

These issues do not apply to most mailing lists, but for a list that is
(necessarily) the primary user support route for a crypto package, they
are very important.  This is *not* an ordinary mailing list; it has to
function under awkward constraints that make various simplistic solutions
inapplicable or undesirable.

You do realize, I hope, that interposing such a manual step might cause
your government to decide that this is not truly a public forum, and thus
you could go to jail if you don't get approval from them before mailing to
it?  If you think this sounds irrational, your government is noted for
making irrational decisions in this area; we can't assume that they will
suddenly start being sensible.  See above about awkward constraints.  You
may be willing to take the risk, but we can't, in good conscience, insist
that all users with problems do so.

The topic of the linux-ipsec mailing list is the FreeS/WAN software.

I frequently see "discussions about spam on a list" overwhelm the
volume of "actual spam" on a list. BOTH kinds of messages are
off-topic messages.  Twenty anti-spam messages take just as long to
detect and discard as twenty spam messages.

The Linux-ipsec list encourages on-topic messages from people who have
not joined the list itself.  We will not censor messages to the list
based on where they originate, or what return address they contain.
In other words, non-subscribers ARE allowed to post, and this will not
change.  My own valid contributions have been rejected out-of-hand by
too many other mailing lists for me to want to impose that censorship
on anybody else's contributions.  And every day I see the damage that
anti-spam zeal is causing in many other ways; that zeal is far more
damaging to the culture of the Internet than the nuisance of spam.

In general, it is the responsibility of recipients to filter,
prioritize, or otherwise manage the handling of email that comes to
them.  It is not the responsibility of the rest of the Internet
community to refrain from sending messages to recipients that they
might not want to see.  If your software infrastructure for managing
your incoming email is insufficient, then improve it.  If you think
the signal-to-noise ratio on linux-ipsec is too poor, then please
unsubscribe.  But don't further increase the noise by posting to the
linux-ipsec list about those topics.

                            FreeS/WAN manual pages

   The various components of Linux FreeS/WAN are of course documented in
   standard Unix manual pages, accessible via the man(1) command.

   Links here take you to an HTML version of the man pages.

Files

   [1225]ipsec.conf(5)
          IPsec configuration and connections

   [1226]ipsec.secrets(5)
          secrets for IKE authentication, either pre-shared keys or RSA
          private keys

   These files are also discussed in the[1227] configuration section.

Commands

   Many users will never give most of the FreeS/WAN commands directly.
   Configure the files listed above correctly and everything should be
   automatic.

   The exceptions are commands for mainpulating the[1228] RSA keys used
   in Pluto authentication:

   [1229]ipsec_rsasigkey(8)
          generate keys

   [1230]ipsec_newhostkey(8)
          generate keys in a convenient format

   [1231]ipsec_showhostkey(8)
          extract[1232] RSA keys from[1233] ipsec.secrets(5) (or
          optionally, another file) and format them for insertion
          in[1234] ipsec.conf(5) or in DNS records

   Note that:
     * These keys are for authentication only. They are not secure for
       encryption.
     * The utility uses random(4) as a source of[1235] random numbers.
       This may block for some time if there is not enough activity on
       the machine to provide the required entropy. You may want to give
       it some bogus activity such as random mouse movements or some
       command such as du /usr > /dev/null &.

   The following commands are fairly likely to be used, if only for
   testing and status checks:

   [1236]ipsec(8)
          invoke IPsec utilities

   [1237]ipsec_setup(8)
          control IPsec subsystem

   [1238]ipsec_auto(8)
          control automatically-keyed IPsec connections

   [1239]ipsec_manual(8)
          take manually-keyed IPsec connections up and down

   [1240]ipsec_ranbits(8)
          generate random bits in ASCII form

   [1241]ipsec_look(8)
          show minimal debugging information

   [1242]ipsec_barf(8)
          spew out collected IPsec debugging information

   The lower-level utilities listed below are normally invoked via
   scripts listed above, but they can also be used directly when
   required.

          manipulate IPsec extended routing tables

   [1244]ipsec_klipsdebug(8)

                            FreeS/WAN and firewalls

   FreeS/WAN, or other IPsec implementations, frequently run on gateway
   machines, the same machines running firewall or packet filtering code.
   This document discusses the relation between the two.

   The firewall code in 2.4 and later kernels is called Netfilter. The
   user-space utility to manage a firewall is iptables(8). See the[1268]
   netfilter/iptables web site for details.

Filtering rules for IPsec packets

   The basic constraint is that an IPsec gateway must have packet filters
   that allow IPsec packets, at least when talking to other IPsec
   gateways:
     * UDP port 500 for[1269] IKE negotiations
     * protocol 50 if you use[1270] ESP encryption and/or authentication
       (the typical case)
     * protocol 51 if you use[1271] AH packet-level authentication

   Your gateway and the other IPsec gateways it communicates with must be
   able to exchange these packets for IPsec to work. Firewall rules must
   allow UDP 500 and at least one of[1272] AH or[1273] ESP on the
   interface that communicates with the other gateway.

   For nearly all FreeS/WAN applications, you must allow UDP port 500 and
   the ESP protocol.

   There are two ways to set this up:

   easier but less flexible
          Just set up your firewall scripts at boot time to allow IPsec
          packets to and from your gateway. Let FreeS/WAN reject any
          bogus packets.

   more work, giving you more precise control
          Have the[1274] ipsec_pluto(8) daemon call scripts to adjust
          firewall rules dynamically as required. This is done by naming
          the scripts in the[1275] ipsec.conf(5) variables prepluto=,
          postpluto= , leftupdown= and rightupdown=.

   Both methods are described in more detail below.

Firewall configuration at boot

   It is possible to set up both firewalling and IPsec with appropriate
   scripts at boot and then not use leftupdown= and rightupdown=, or use
   them only for simple up and down operations.

   Basically, the technique is
     * allow IPsec packets (typically, IKE on UDP port 500 plus ESP,
       protocol 50)
          + incoming, if the destination address is your gateway (and
            optionally, only from known senders)
          + outgoing, with the from address of your gateway (and
            optionally, only to known receivers)
     * let[1276] Pluto deal with IKE
     * let[1277] KLIPS deal with ESP

   Since Pluto authenticates its partners during the negotiation, and
   KLIPS drops packets for which no tunnel has been negotiated, this may
   be all you need.

  A simple set of rules

   In simple cases, you need only a few rules, as in this example:
# allow IPsec
#
# IKE negotiations
iptables -I INPUT  -p udp --sport 500 --dport 500 -j ACCEPT
iptables -I OUTPUT -p udp --sport 500 --dport 500 -j ACCEPT
# ESP encryption and authentication
iptables -I INPUT  -p 50 -j ACCEPT
iptables -I OUTPUT -p 50 -j ACCEPT

   This should be all you need to allow IPsec through lokkit, which ships
   with Red Hat 9, on its medium security setting. Once you've tweaked to
   your satisfaction, save your active rule set with:
service iptables save

  Other rules

   You can add additional rules, or modify existing ones, to work with
   IPsec and with your network and policies. We give a some examples in
   this section.

   However, while it is certainly possible to create an elaborate set of
   rules yourself (please let us know via the[1278] mailing list if you
   do), it may be both easier and more secure to use a set which has
   already been published and tested.

   The published rule sets we know of are described in the[1279] next
   section.

    Adding additional rules

   If necessary, you can add additional rules to:

   reject IPsec packets that are not to or from known gateways
          This possibility is discussed in more detail[1280] later

   allow systems behind your gateway to build IPsec tunnels that pass
          through the gateway
          This possibility is discussed in more detail[1281] later

   filter incoming packets emerging from KLIPS.
          Firewall rules can recognise packets emerging from IPsec. They
          are marked as arriving on an interface such as ipsec0, rather
          than eth0, ppp0 or whatever.

   It is therefore reasonably straightforward to filter these packets in
   whatever way suits your situation.

    Modifying existing rules

   In some cases rules that work fine before you add IPsec may require
   modification to work with IPsec.

   This is especially likely for rules that deal with interfaces on the
   Internet side of your system. IPsec adds a new interface; often the
   rules must change to take account of that.

   For example, consider the rules given in[1282] this section of the
   Netfilter documentation:
Most people just have a single PPP connection to the Internet, and don't
want anyone coming back into their network, or the firewall:

    ## Insert connection-tracking modules (not needed if built into kernel).
    # insmod ip_conntrack
    # insmod ip_conntrack_ftp

    ## Create chain which blocks new connections, except if coming from inside.
    # iptables -N block
    # iptables -A block -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
    # iptables -A block -m state --state NEW -i ! ppp0 -j ACCEPT
    # iptables -A block -j DROP

    ## Jump to that chain from INPUT and FORWARD chains.
    # iptables -A INPUT -j block
    # iptables -A FORWARD -j block

   On an IPsec gateway, those rules may need to be modified. The above
   allows new connections from anywhere except ppp0. That means new
   connections from ipsec0 are allowed.

   Do you want to allow anyone who can establish an IPsec connection to
   your gateway to initiate TCP connections to any service on your
   network? Almost certainly not if you are using opportunistic
   encryption. Quite possibly not even if you have only explicitly
   configured connections.

   To disallow incoming connections from ipsec0, change the middle
   section above to:
    ## Create chain which blocks new connections, except if coming from inside.
    # iptables -N block
    # iptables -A block -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
    # iptables -A block -m state --state NEW -i ppp+ -j DROP
    # iptables -A block -m state --state NEW -i ipsec+ -j DROP
    # iptables -A block -m state --state NEW -i -j ACCEPT
    # iptables -A block -j DROP

   The original rules accepted NEW connections from anywhere except ppp0.
   This version drops NEW connections from any PPP interface (ppp+) and
   from any ipsec interface (ipsec+), then accepts the survivors.

   Of course, these are only examples. You will need to adapt them to
   your own situation.

  Published rule sets

   Several sets of firewall rules that work with FreeS/WAN are available.

    Scripts based on Ranch's work

   One user, Rob Hutton, posted his boot time scripts to the mailing
   list, and we included them in previous versions of this documentation.
   They are still available from our[1283] web site. However, they were
   for an earlier FreeS/WAN version so we no longer recommend them. Also,
   they had some bugs. See this[1284] message.

   Those scripts were based on David Ranch's scripts for his "Trinity OS"
   for setting up a secure Linux. Check his[1285] home page for the
   latest version and for information on his[1286] book on securing
   Linux. If you are going to base your firewalling on Ranch's scripts,
   we recommend using his latest version, and sending him any IPsec
   modifications you make for incorporation into later versions.

    The Seattle firewall

   We have had several mailing lists reports of good results using
   FreeS/WAN with Seawall (the Seattle Firewall). See that
   project's[1287] home page on Sourceforge.

    The RCF scripts

   Another set of firewall scripts with IPsec support are the RCF or
   rc.firewall scripts. See their[1288] home page.

    Asgard scripts

   [1289]Asgard's Realm has set of firewall scripts with FreeS/WAN
   support, for 2.4 kernels and iptables.

    User scripts from the mailing list

   One user gave considerable detail on his scripts, including
   supporting[1290] IPX through the tunnel. His message was too long to
   conveniently be quoted here, so I've put it in a[1291] separate file.

Calling firewall scripts, named in ipsec.conf(5)

   The[1292] ipsec.conf(5) configuration file has three pairs of
   parameters used to specify an interface between FreeS/WAN and
   firewalling code.

   Note that using these is not required if you have a static firewall
   setup. In that case, you just set your firewall up at boot time (in a
   way that permits the IPsec connections you want) and do not change it
   thereafter. Omit all the FreeS/WAN firewall parameters and FreeS/WAN
   will not attempt to adjust firewall rules at all. See[1293] above for
   some information on appropriate scripts.

   However, if you want your firewall rules to change when IPsec
   connections change, then you need to use these parameters.

  Scripts called at IPsec start and stop

   One pair of parmeters are set in the config setup section of the[1294]
   ipsec.conf(5) file and affect all connections:

   prepluto=
          script to be called before[1295] pluto(8) IKE daemon is
          started.

   postpluto=
          script to be called after[1296] pluto(8) IKE daemon is stopped.

   These parameters allow you to change firewall parameters whenever
   IPsec is started or stopped.

   They can also be used in other ways. For example, you might have
   prepluto add a module to your kernel for the secure network interface
   or make a dialup connection, and then have postpluto remove the module
   or take the connection down.

  Scripts called at connection up and down

   The other parameters are set in connection descriptions. They can be
   set in individual connection descriptions, and could even call
   different scripts for each connection for maximum flexibility. In most
   applications, however, it makes sense to use only one script and to
   call it from conn %default section so that it applies to all
   connections.

   You can:

   either
          set leftfirewall=yes or rightfirewall=yes to use our supplied
          default script

   or
          assign a name in a leftupdown= or rightupdown= line to use your
          own script

   Note that only one of these should be used. You cannot sensibly use
   both. Since our default script is obsolete (designed for firewalls
   using ipfwadm(8) on 2.0 kernels), most users who need this service
   will need to write a custom script.

    The default script

   We supply a default script named _updown.

   leftfirewall=

   rightfirewall=
          indicates that the gateway is doing firewalling and that[1297]
          pluto(8) should poke holes in the firewall as required.

   Set these to yes and Pluto will call our default script _updown with
   appropriate arguments whenever it:
     * starts or stops IPsec services
     * brings a connection up or down

   The supplied default _updown script is appropriate for simple cases
   using the ipfwadm(8) firewalling package.

    User-written scripts

   You can also write your own script and have Pluto call it. Just put
   the script's name in one of these[1298] ipsec.conf(5) lines:

   leftupdown=

   rightupdown=
          specifies a script to call instead of our default script
          _updown.

   Your script should take the same arguments and use the same
   environment variables as _updown. See the "updown command" section of
   the[1299] ipsec_pluto(8) man page for details.

   Note that you should not modify our _updown script in place . If you
   did that, then upgraded FreeS/WAN, the upgrade would install a new
   default script, overwriting your changes.

  Scripts for ipchains or iptables

   Our _updown is for firewalls using ipfwadm(8), the firewall code for
   the 2.0 series of Linux kernels. If you are using the more recent
   packages ipchains(8) (for 2.2 kernels) or iptables(8) (2.4 kernels),
   then you must do one of:
     * use static firewall rules which are set up at boot time as
       described[1300] above and do not need to be changed by Pluto
     * limit yourself to ipchains(8)'s ipfwadm(8) emulation mode in order
       to use our script
     * write your own script and call it with leftupdown and rightupdown.

   You can write a script to do whatever you need with firewalling.
   Specify its name in a [left|right]updown= parameter in[1301]
   ipsec.conf(5) and Pluto will automatically call it for you.

   The arguments Pluto passes such a script are the same ones it passes
   to our default _updown script, so the best way to build yours is to
   copy ours and modify the copy.

   Note, however, that you should not modify our _updown script in place.
   If you did that, then upgraded FreeS/WAN, the upgrade would install a
   new default script, overwriting your changes.

A complication: IPsec vs. NAT

   [1302]Network Address Translation, also known as IP masquerading, is a
   method of allocating IP addresses dynamically, typically in
   circumstances where the total number of machines which need to access
   the Internet exceeds the supply of IP addresses.

   Any attempt to perform NAT operations on IPsec packets between the
   IPsec gateways creates a basic conflict:
     * IPsec wants to authenticate packets and ensure they are unaltered
       on a gateway-to-gateway basis
     * NAT rewrites packet headers as they go by
     * IPsec authentication fails if packets are rewritten anywhere
       between the IPsec gateways

   For[1303] AH, which authenticates parts of the packet header including
   source and destination IP addresses, this is fatal. If NAT changes
   those fields, AH authentication fails.

   For[1304] IKE and[1305] ESP it is not necessarily fatal, but is
   certainly an unwelcome complication.

  NAT on or behind the IPsec gateway works

   This problem can be avoided by having the masquerading take place on
   or behind the IPsec gateway.

   This can be done physically with two machines, one physically behind
   the other. A picture, using SG to indicate IPsec S ecurity Gateways,
   is:
      clients --- NAT ----- SG ---------- SG
                  two machines

   In this configuration, the actual client addresses need not be given
   in the leftsubnet= parameter of the FreeS/WAN connection description.
   The security gateway just delivers packets to the NAT box; it needs
   only that machine's address. What that machine does with them does not
   affect FreeS/WAN.

   A more common setup has one machine performing both functions:
      clients ----- NAT/SG ---------------SG
                  one machine

   Here you have a choice of techniques depending on whether you want to
   make your client subnet visible to clients on the other end:
     * If you want the single gateway to behave like the two shown above,
       with your clients hidden behind the NAT, then omit the leftsubnet=
       parameter. It then defaults to the gateway address. Clients on the
       other end then talk via the tunnel only to your gateway. The
       gateway takes packets emerging from the tunnel, applies normal
       masquerading, and forwards them to clients.
     * If you want to make your client machines visible, then give the
       client subnet addresses as the leftsubnet= parameter in the
       connection description and

        either
                set leftfirewall=yes to use the default updown script

        or
                use your own script by giving its name in a leftupdown=
                parameter

       These scripts are described in their own[1306] section.
       In this case, no masquerading is done. Packets to or from the
       client subnet are encrypted or decrypted without any change to
       their client subnet addresses, although of course the
       encapsulating packets use gateway addresses in their headers.
       Clients behind the right security gateway see a route via that
       gateway to the left subnet.

  NAT between gateways is problematic

   We recommend not trying to build IPsec connections which pass through
   a NAT machine. This setup poses problems:
      clients --- SG --- NAT ---------- SG

   If you must try it, some references are:
     * Jean_Francois Nadeau's document on doing[1307] IPsec behind NAT
     * [1308]VPN masquerade patches to make a Linux NAT box handle IPsec
       packets correctly

  Other references on NAT and IPsec

   Other documents which may be relevant include:
     * an Internet Draft on[1309] IPsec and NAT which may eventually
       evolve into a standard solution for this problem.
     * an informational[1310] RFC, Security Model with Tunnel-mode IPsec
       for NAT Domains .
     * an[1311] article in Cisco's Internet Protocol Journal

Other complications

   Of course simply allowing UDP 500 and ESP packets is not the whole
   story. Various other issues arise in making IPsec and packet filters
   co-exist and even co-operate. Some of them are summarised below.

  IPsec through the gateway

   Basic IPsec packet filtering rules deal only with packets addressed to
   or sent from your IPsec gateway.

   It is a separate policy decision whether to permit such packets to
   pass through the gateway so that client machines can build end-to-end
   IPsec tunnels of their own. This may not be practical if you are
   using[1312] NAT (IP masquerade) on your gateway, and may conflict with
   some corporate security policies.

   Where possible, allowing this is almost certainly a good idea. Using
   IPsec on an end-to-end basis is more secure than gateway-to-gateway.

   Doing it is quite simple. You just need firewall rules that allow UDP
   port 500 and protocols 50 and 51 to pass through your gateway. If you
   wish, you can of course restrict this to certain hosts.

  Preventing non-IPsec traffic

   You can also filter everything but UDP port 500 and ESP or AH to
   restrict traffic to IPsec only, either for anyone communicating with
   your host or just for specific partners.

   One application of this is for the telecommuter who might have:
     Sunset==========West------------------East ================= firewall ---
the Internet
         home network      untrusted net        corporate network

   The subnet on the right is 0.0.0.0/0, the whole Internet. The West
   gateway is set up so that it allows only IPsec packets to East in or
   out.

   This configuration is used in AT&T Research's network. For details,
   see the[1313] papers links in our introduction.

   Another application would be to set up firewall rules so that an
   internal machine, such as an employees-only web server, could not talk
   to the outside world except via specific IPsec tunnels.

  Filtering packets from unknown gateways

   It is possible to use firewall rules to restrict UDP 500, ESP and AH
   packets so that these packets are accepted only from known gateways.
   This is not strictly necessary since FreeS/WAN will discard packets
   from unknown gateways. You might, however, want to do it for any of a
   number of reasons. For example:
     * Arguably, "belt and suspenders" is the sensible approach to
       security. If you can block a potential attack in two ways, use
       both. The only question is whether to look for a third way after
       implementing the first two.
     * Some admins may prefer to use the firewall code this way because
       they prefer firewall logging to FreeS/WAN's logging.
     * You may need it to implement your security policy. Consider an
       employee working at home, and a policy that says traffic from the
       home system to the Internet at large must go first via IPsec to
       the corporate LAN and then out to the Internet via the corporate
       firewall. One way to do that is to make ipsec0 the default route
       on the home gateway and provide exceptions only for UDP 500 and
       ESP to the corporate gateway. Everything else is then routed via
       the tunnel to the corporate gateway.

   It is not possible to use only static firewall rules for this
   filtering if you do not know the other gateways' IP addresses in
   advance, for example if you have "road warriors" who may connect from
   a different address each time or if want to do[1314] opportunistic
   encryption to arbitrary gateways. In these cases, you can accept UDP
   500 IKE packets from anywhere, then use the[1315] updown script
   feature of[1316] pluto(8) to dynamically adjust firewalling for each
   negotiated tunnel.

   Firewall packet filtering does not much reduce the risk of a[1317]
   denial of service attack on FreeS/WAN. The firewall can drop packets
   from unknown gateways, but KLIPS does that quite efficiently anyway,
   so you gain little. The firewall cannot drop otherwise legitmate
   packets that fail KLIPS authentication, so it cannot protect against
   an attack designed to exhaust resources by making FreeS/WAN perform
   many expensive authentication operations.

   In summary, firewall filtering of IPsec packets from unknown gateways
   is possible but not strictly necessary.

Other packet filters

   When the IPsec gateway is also acting as your firewall, other packet
   filtering rules will be in play. In general, those are outside the
   scope of this document. See our[1318] Linux firewall links for
   information. There are a few types of packet, however, which can
   affect the operation of FreeS/WAN or of diagnostic tools commonly used
   with it. These are discussed below.

  ICMP filtering

   [1319]ICMP is the Internet Control Message Protocol. It is used for
   messages between IP implementations themselves, whereas IP used is
   used between the clients of those implementations. ICMP is,
   unsurprisingly, used for control messages. For example, it is used to
   notify a sender that a desination is not reachable, or to tell a
   router to reroute certain packets elsewhere.

   ICMP handling is tricky for firewalls.
     * You definitely want some ICMP messages to get through; things
       won't work without them. For example, your clients need to know if
       some destination they ask for is unreachable.
     * On the other hand, you do equally definitely do not want untrusted
       folk sending arbitrary control messages to your machines. Imagine
       what someone moderately clever and moderately malicious could do
       to you, given control of your network's routing.

   ICMP does not use ports. Messages are distinguished by a "message
   type" field and, for some types, by an additional "code" field. The
   definitive list of types and codes is on the[1320] IANA site.

   One expert uses this definition for ICMP message types to be dropped
   at the firewall.
# ICMP types which lack socially redeeming value.
#  5     Redirect
#  9     Router Advertisement
# 10     Router Selection
# 15     Information Request
# 16     Information Reply
# 17     Address Mask Request
# 18     Address Mask Reply

badicmp='5 9 10 15 16 17 18'

   A more conservative approach would be to make a list of allowed types
   and drop everything else.

   Whichever way you do it, your ICMP filtering rules on a FreeS/WAN
   gateway should allow at least the following ICMP packet types:

   echo (type 8)

   echo reply (type 0)
          These are used by ping(1). We recommend allowing both types
          through the tunnel and to or from your gateway's external
          interface, since ping(1) is an essential testing tool.

          It is fairly common for firewalls to drop ICMP echo packets
          addressed to machines behind the firewall. If that is your
          policy, please create an exception for such packets arriving
          via an IPsec tunnel, at least during intial testing of those
          tunnels.

   destination unreachable (type 3)
          This is used, with code 4 (Fragmentation Needed and Don't
          Fragment was Set) in the code field, to control[1321] path MTU
          discovery. Since IPsec processing adds headers, enlarges
          packets and may cause fragmentation, an IPsec gateway should be
          able to send and receive these ICMP messages on both inside and
          outside interfaces.

  UDP packets for traceroute

   The traceroute(1) utility uses UDP port numbers from 33434 to
   approximately 33633. Generally, these should be allowed through for
   troubleshooting.

   Some firewalls drop these packets to prevent outsiders exploring the
   protected network with traceroute(1). If that is your policy, consider
   creating an exception for such packets arriving via an IPsec tunnel,
   at least during intial testing of those tunnels.

  UDP for L2TP

   Windows 2000 does, and products designed for compatibility with it
   may, build[1322] L2TP tunnels over IPsec connections.

   For this to work, you must allow UDP protocol 1701 packets coming out
   of your tunnels to continue to their destination. You can, and
   probably should, block such packets to or from your external
   interfaces, but allow them from ipsec0.

   See also our Windows 2000[1323] interoperation discussion.

How it all works: IPsec packet details

   IPsec uses three main types of packet:

   [1324]IKE uses the UDP protocol and port 500 .
          Unless you are using only (less secure, not recommended) manual
          keying, you need IKE to negotiate connection parameters,
          acceptable algorithms, key sizes and key setup. IKE handles
          everything required to set up, rekey, repair or tear down IPsec
          connections.

   [1325]ESP is protocol number 50
          This is required for encrypted connections.

   [1326]AH is protocol number 51
          This can be used where only authentication, not encryption, is
          required.

   All of those packets should have appropriate IPsec gateway addresses
   in both the to and from IP header fields. Firewall rules can check
   this if you wish, though it is not strictly necessary. This is
   discussed in more detail[1327] later.

   IPsec processing of incoming packets authenticates them then removes
   the ESP or AH header and decrypts if necessary. Successful processing
   exposes an inner packet which is then delivered back to the firewall
   machinery, marked as having arrived on an ipsec[0-3] interface.
   Firewall rules can use that interface label to distinguish these
   packets from unencrypted packets which are labelled with the physical
   interface they arrived on (or perhaps with a non-IPsec virtual
   interface such as ppp0).

   One of our users sent a mailing list message with a[1328] diagram of
   the packet flow.

  ESP and AH do not have ports

   Some protocols, such as TCP and UDP, have the notion of ports. Others
   protocols, including ESP and AH, do not. Quite a few IPsec newcomers
   have become confused on this point. There are no ports in the ESP or
   AH protocols, and no ports used for them. For these protocols, the
   idea of ports is completely irrelevant.

  Header layout

   The protocol numbers for ESP or AH are used in the 'next header' field
   of the IP header. On most non-IPsec packets, that field would have one
   of:
     * 1 for ICMP
     * 4 for IP-in-IP encapsulation
     * 6 for TCP
     * 17 for UDP
     * ... or one of about 100 other possibilities listed by[1329] IANA

   Each header in the sequence tells what the next header will be. IPsec
   adds headers for ESP or AH near the beginning of the sequence. The
   original headers are kept and the 'next header' fields adjusted so
   that all headers can be correctly interpreted.

   For example, using [ ] to indicate data protected by ESP and
   unintelligible to an eavesdropper between the gateways:
     * a simple packet might have only IP and TCP headers with:
          + IP header says next header --> TCP
          + TCP header port number --> which process to send data to
          + data
     * with ESP[1330] transport mode encapsulation, that packet would
       have:
          + IP header says next header --> ESP
          + ESP header [ says next --> TCP
          + TCP header port number --> which process to send data to
          + data ]
       Note that the IP header is outside ESP protection, visible to an
       attacker, and that the final destination must be the gateway.
     * with ESP in[1331] tunnel mode, we might have:
          + IP header says next header --> ESP
          + ESP header [ says next --> IP
          + IP header says next header --> TCP
          + TCP header port number --> which process to send data to
          + data ]
       Here the inner IP header is protected by ESP, unreadable by an
       attacker. Also, the inner header can have a different IP address
       than the outer IP header, so the decrypted packet can be routed
       from the IPsec gateway to a final destination which may be another
       machine.

   Part of the ESP header itself is encrypted, which is why the [
   indicating protected data appears in the middle of some lines above.
   The next header field of the ESP header is protected. This makes[1332]
   traffic analysis more difficult. The next header field would tell an
   eavesdropper whether your packet was UDP to the gateway, TCP to the
   gateway, or encapsulated IP. It is better not to give this information
   away. A clever attacker may deduce some of it from the pattern of
   packet sizes and timings, but we need not make it easy.

   IPsec allows various combinations of these to match local policies,
   including combinations that use both AH and ESP headers or that nest
   multiple copies of these headers.

   For example, suppose my employer has an IPsec VPN running between two
   offices so all packets travelling between the gateways for those
   offices are encrypted. If gateway policies allow it (The admins could
   block UDP 500 and protocols 50 and 51 to disallow it), I can build an
   IPsec tunnel from my desktop to a machine in some remote office. Those
   packets will have one ESP header throughout their life, for my
   end-to-end tunnel. For part of the route, however, they will also have
   another ESP layer for the corporate VPN's encapsulation. The whole
   header scheme for a packet on the Internet might be:
     * IP header (with gateway address) says next header --> ESP
     * ESP header [ says next --> IP
     * IP header (with receiving machine address) says next header -->
       ESP
     * ESP header [ says next --> TCP
     * TCP header port number --> which process to send data to
     * data ]]

   The first ESP (outermost) header is for the corporate VPN. The inner
   ESP header is for the secure machine-to-machine link.

  DHR on the updown script

   Here are some mailing list comments from[1333] pluto(8) developer Hugh
   Redelmeier on an earlier draft of this document:
There are many important things left out

- firewalling is important but must reflect (implement) policy.  Since
  policy isn't the same for all our customers, and we're not experts,
  we should concentrate on FW and MASQ interactions with FreeS/WAN.

- we need a diagram to show packet flow WITHIN ONE MACHINE, assuming
  IKE, IPsec, FW, and MASQ are all done on that machine.  The flow is
  obvious if the components are run on different machines (trace the
  cables).

  IKE input:
        + packet appears on public IF, as UDP port 500
        + input firewalling rules are applied (may discard)
        + Pluto sees the packet.

  IKE output:
        + Pluto generates the packet & writes to public IF, UDP port 500
        + output firewalling rules are applied (may discard)
        + packet sent out public IF

  IPsec input, with encapsulated packet, outer destination of this host:
        + packet appears on public IF, protocol 50 or 51.  If this
          packet is the result of decapsulation, it will appear
          instead on the paired ipsec IF.
        + input firewalling rules are applied (but packet is opaque)
        + KLIPS decapsulates it, writes result to paired ipsec IF
        + input firewalling rules are applied to resulting packet
          as input on ipsec IF
        + if the destination of the packet is this machine, the
          packet is passed on to the appropriate protocol handler.
          If the original packet was encapsulated more than once
          and the new outer destination is this machine, that
          handler will be KLIPS.
        + otherwise:
          * routing is done for the resulting packet.  This may well
            direct it into KLIPS for encoding or encrypting.  What
            happens then is described elsewhere.
          * forwarding firewalling rules are applied
          * output firewalling rules are applied
          * the packet is sent where routing specified

 IPsec input, with encapsulated packet, outer destination of another host:
        + packet appears on some IF, protocol 50 or 51
        + input firewalling rules are applied (but packet is opaque)
        + routing selects where to send the packet
        + forwarding firewalling rules are applied (but packet is opaque)
        + packet forwarded, still encapsulated

  IPsec output, from this host or from a client:
        + if from a client, input firewalling rules are applied as the
          packet arrives on the private IF
        + routing directs the packet to an ipsec IF (this is how the
          system decides KLIPS processing is required)
        + if from a client, forwarding firewalling rules are applied
        + KLIPS eroute mechanism matches the source and destination
          to registered eroutes, yielding a SPI group.  This dictates
          processing, and where the resulting packet is to be sent
          (the destinations SG and the nexthop).
        + output firewalling is not applied to the resulting
          encapsulated packet

- Until quite recently, KLIPS would double encapsulate packets that
  didn't strictly need to be.  Firewalling should be prepared for
  those packets showing up as ESP and AH protocol input packets on
  an ipsec IF.

- MASQ processing seems to be done as if it were part of the
  forwarding firewall processing (this should be verified).

- If a firewall is being used, it is likely the case that it needs to
  be adjusted whenever IPsec SAs are added or removed.  Pluto invokes
  a script to do this (and to adjust routing) at suitable times.  The
  default script is only suitable for ipfwadm-managed firewalls.  Under
  LINUX 2.2.x kernels, ipchains can be managed by ipfwadm (emulation),
  but ipchains more powerful if manipulated using the ipchains command.
  In this case, a custom updown script must be used.

  We think that the flexibility of ipchains precludes us supplying an
  updown script that would be widely appropriate.

                     Linux FreeS/WAN Troubleshooting Guide

Overview

   This document covers several general places where you might have a
   problem:
    1. [1334]During install.
    2. [1335]During the negotiation process.
    3. [1336]Using an established connection.

   This document also contains[1337] notes which expand on points made in
   these sections, and tips for[1338] problem reporting. If the other end
   of your connection is not FreeS/WAN, you'll also want to read
   our[1339] interoperation document.

1. During Install

  1.1 RPM install gotchas

   With the RPM method:
     * Be sure you have installed both the userland tools and the kernel
       components. One will not work without the other. For example, when
       using FreeS/WAN-produced RPMs for our 2.03 release, you need both:
    freeswan-userland-2.03_2.4.20_20.9-0.i386.rpm
    freeswan-module-2.03_2.4.20_20.9-0.i386.rpm

  1.2 Problems installing from source

   When installing from source, you may find these problems:
     * Missing library. See[1340] this FAQ.
     * Missing utilities required for compile. See this[1341] checklist.
     * Kernel version incompatibility. See[1342] this FAQ.
     * Another compile problem. Find information in the out.* files, ie.
       out.kpatch, out.kbuild, created at compile time in the top-level
       Linux FreeS/WAN directory. Error messages generated by KLIPS
       during the boot sequence are accessible with the dmesg command.
       Check the list archives and the List in Brief to see if this is a
       known issue. If it is not, report it to the bugs list as described
       in our[1343] problem reporting section. In some cases, you may be
       asked to provide debugging information using gdb; details[1344]
       below.
     * If your kernel compiles but you fail to install your new
       FreeS/WAN-enabled kernel, review the sections on[1345] installing
       the patched kernel, and[1346] testing to see if install succeeded.

  1.3 Install checks

   ipsec verify checks a number of FreeS/WAN essentials. Here are some
   hints on what do to when your system doesn't check out:

   Problem Status Action
   ipsec not on-path

   Add /usr/local/sbin to your PATH.
   Missing KLIPS support critical See[1347] this FAQ.
   No RSA private key

   Follow[1348] these instructions to create an RSA key pair for your
   host. RSA keys are:
     * required for opportunistic encryption, and
     * our preferred method to authenticate pre-configured connections.

   pluto not running critical
service ipsec start

   No port 500 hole critical Open port 500 for IKE negotiation.
   Port 500 check N/A   Check that port 500 is open for IKE negotiation.
   Failed DNS checks   Opportunistic encryption requires information from
   DNS. To set this up, see[1349] our instructions.
   No public IP address   Check that the interface which you want to
   protect with IPSec is up and running.

  1.3 Troubleshooting OE

   OE should work with no local configuration, if you have posted DNS TXT
   records according to the instructions in our[1350] quickstart guide.
   If you encounter trouble, try these hints. We welcome additional hints
   via the[1351] users' mailing list.

   Symptom Problem Action
   You're running FreeS/WAN 2.01 (or later), and initiating a connection
   to FreeS/WAN 2.00 (or earlier). In your logs, you see a message like:
no RSA public key known for '192.0.2.13';
DNS search for KEY failed (no KEY record
for 13.2.0.192.in-addr.arpa.)

   The older FreeS/WAN logs no error. A protocol level incompatibility
   between 2.01 (or later) and 2.00 (or earlier) causes this error. It
   occurs when a FreeS/WAN 2.01 (or later) box for which no KEY record is
   posted attempts to initiate an OE connection to older FreeS/WAN
   versions (2.00 and earlier). Note that older versions can initiate to
   newer versions without this error. If you control the peer host,
   upgrade its FreeS/WAN to 2.01 (or later), and post new style TXT
   records for it. If not, but if you know its sysadmin, perhaps a quick
   note is in order. If neither option is possible, you can ease the
   transition by posting an old style KEY record (created with a command
   like "ipsec showhostkey --key") to the reverse map for the FreeS/WAN
   2.01 (or later) box.
   OE host is very slow to contact other hosts. Slow DNS service while
   running OE. It's a good idea to run a caching DNS server on your OE
   host, as outlined in[1352] this mailing list message. If your DNS
   servers are elsewhere, put their IPs in the clear policy group, and
   re-read groups with
ipsec auto --rereadgroups

Can't Opportunistically initiate for
192.0.2.2 to 192.0.2.3: no TXT record
for 13.2.0.192.in-addr.arpa.

   Peer is not set up for OE.

   None. Plenty of hosts on the Internet do not run OE. If, however, you
   have set OE up on that peer, this may indicate that you need to wait
   up to 48 hours for its DNS records to propagate.
   ipsec verify does not find DNS records:
...
Looking for TXT in forward map:
                xy.example.com...[FAILED]
Looking for TXT in reverse map...[FAILED]
...

   You also experience authentication failure:
Possible authentication failure:
no acceptable response to our
first encrypted message

   DNS records are not posted or have not propagated. Did you post the
   DNS records necessary for OE? If not, do so using the instructions in
   our[1353] quickstart guide. If so, wait up to 48 hours for the DNS
   records to propagate.
   ipsec verify does not find DNS records, and you experience
   authentication failure. For iOE, your ID does not match location of
   forward DNS record. In config setup , change myid= to match the
   forward DNS where you posted the record. Restart FreeS/WAN. For
   reference, see our[1354] iOE instructions.
   ipsec verify finds DNS records, yet there is still authentication
   failure. ( ? ) DNS records are malformed. Re-create the records and
   send new copies to your DNS administrator.
   ipsec verify finds DNS records, yet there is still authentication
   failure. ( ? ) DNS records show different keys for a gateway vs. its
   subnet hosts. All TXT records for boxes protected by an OE gateway
   must contain the gateway's public key. Re-create and re-post any
   incorrect records using[1355] these instructions.
   OE gateway loses connectivity to its subnet. The gateway's routing
   table shows routes to the subnet through IPsec interfaces. The subnet
   is part of the private or block policy group on the gateway. Remove
   the subnet from the group, and reread groups with
ipsec auto --rereadgroups

   OE does not work to hosts on the local LAN. This is a known issue.
   See[1356] this list of known issues with OE.
   FreeS/WAN does not seem to be executing your default policy. In your
   logs, you see a message like:
/etc/ipsec.d/policies/iprivate-or-clear"
line 14: subnet "0.0.0.0/0",
source 192.0.2.13/32,
already "private-or-clear"

   [1357]Fullnet in a policy group file defines your default policy.
   Fullnet should normally be present in only one policy group file. The
   fine print: you can have two default policies defined so long as they
   protect different local endpoints (e.g. the FreeS/WAN gateway and a
   subnet). Find all policies which contain fullnet with:
grep -F 0.0.0.0/0 /etc/ipsec.d/policies/*

   then remove the unwanted occurrence(s).

2. During Negotiation

   When you fail to bring up a tunnel, you'll need to find out:
     * [1358]what your connection state is, and often
     * [1359]an error message.

   before you can[1360] diagnose your problem .

  2.1 Determine Connection State

    Finding current state

   You can see connection states (STATE_MAIN_I1 and so on) when you bring
   up a connection on the command line. If you have missed this, or
   brought up your connection automatically, use:
ipsec auto --status

   The most relevant state is the last one reached.

    What's this supposed to look like?

   Negotiations should proceed though various states, in the processes
   of:
    1. IKE negotiations (aka Phase 1, Main Mode, STATE_MAIN_*)
    2. IPSEC negotiations (aka Phase 2, Quick Mode, STATE_QUICK_*)

   These are done and a connection is established when you see messages
   like:
    000 #21: "myconn" STATE_MAIN_I4 (ISAKMP SA established)...
    000 #2: "myconn" STATE_QUICK_I2 (sent QI2, IPsec SA established)...

   Look for the key phrases are "ISAKMP SA established" and "IPSec SA
   established", with the relevant connection name. Often, this happens
   at STATE_MAIN_I4 and STATE_QUICK_I2, respectively.

   ipsec auto --status will tell you what states have been achieved,
   rather than the current state. Since determining the current state is
   rather more difficult to do, current state information is not
   available from Linux FreeS/WAN. If you are actively bringing a
   connection up, the status report's last states for that connection
   likely reflect its current state. Beware, though, of the case where a
   connection was correctly brought up but is now downed: Linux FreeS/WAN
   will not notice this until it attempts to rekey. Meanwhile, the last
   known state indicates that the connection has been established.

   If your connection is stuck at STATE_MAIN_I1, skip straight to[1361]
   here.

  2.2 Finding error text

   Solving most errors will require you to find verbose error text,
   either on the command line or in the logs.

    Verbose start for more information

   Note that you can get more detail from ipsec auto using the --verbose
   flag:
    ipsec auto --verbose --up west-east

   More complete information can be gleaned from the[1362] log files.

    Debug levels count

   The amount of description you'll get here depends on ipsec.conf debug
   settings, klipsdebug= and plutodebug=. When troubleshooting, set at
   least one of these to all, and when done, reset it to none so your
   logs don't fill up. Note that you must have enabled the
   klipsdebug[1363] compile-time option for the klipsdebug configuration
   switch to work.

   For negotiation problems plutodebug is most relevant. klipsdebug
   applies mainly to attempts to use an already-established connection.
   See also[1364] this description of the division of duties within Linux
   FreeS/WAN.

   After raising your debug levels, restart Linux FreeS/WAN to ensure
   that ipsec.conf is reread, then recreate the error to generate verbose
   logs.

    ipsec barf for lots of debugging information

   [1365]ipsec barf (8) collects a bunch of useful debugging information,
   including these logs Use the command
    ipsec barf > barf.west

   to generate one.

    Find the error

   Search out the failure point in your logs. Are there a handful of
   lines which succinctly describe how things are going wrong or contrary
   to your expectation? Sometimes the failure point is not immediately
   obvious: Linux FreeS/WAN's errors are usually not marked "Error". Have
   a look in the[1366] FAQ for what some common failures look like.

   Tip: problems snowball. Focus your efforts on the first problem, which
   is likely to be the cause of later errors.

    Play both sides

   Also find error text on the peer IPSec box. This gives you two
   perspectives on the same failure.

   At times you will require information which only one side has. The
   peer can merely indicate the presence of an error, and its approximate
   point in the negotiations. If one side keeps retrying, it may be
   because there is a show stopper on the other side. Have a look at the
   other side and figure out what it doesn't like.

   If the other end is not Linux FreeS/WAN, the principle is the same:
   replicate the error with its most verbose logging on, and capture the
   output to a file.

  2.3 Interpreting a Negotiation Error

    Connection stuck at STATE_MAIN_I1

   This error commonly happens because IKE (port 500) packets, needed to
   negotiate an IPSec connection, cannot travel freely between your IPSec
   gateways. See[1367] our firewall document for details.

    Other errors

   Other errors require a bit more digging. Use the following resources:
     * [1368]the FAQ . Since this document is constantly updated, the
       snapshot's FAQ may have a new entry relevant to your problem.
     * our[1369] background document . Special considerations which,
       while not central to Linux FreeS/WAN, are often tripped over.
       Includes problems with[1370] packet fragmentation, and
       considerations for testing opportunism.
     * the[1371] list archives. Each of the searchable archives works
       differently, so it's worth checking each. Use a search term which
       is generic, but identifies your error, for example "No connection
       is known for".
       Often, you will find that your question has been answered in the
       past. Finding an archived answer is quicker than asking the list.
       You may, however, find similar questions without answers. If you
       do, send their URLs to the list with your trouble report. The
       additional examples may help the list tech support person find
       your answer.
     * Look into the code where the error is being generated. The pluto
       code is nicely documented with comments and meaningful variable
       names.

   If you have failed to solve your problem with the help of these
   resources, send a detailed problem report to the users list, following
   these[1372] guidelines.

3. Using a Connection

  3.1 Orienting yourself

    How do I know if it works?

   Test your connection by sending packets through it. The simplest way
   to do this is with ping, but the ping needs to test the correct
   tunnel. See[1373] this example scenario if you don't understand this.

   If your ping returns, test any other connections you've brought u all
   check out, great. You may wish to[1374] test with large packets for
   MTU problems.

    ipsec barf is useful again

   If your ping fails to return, generate an ipsec barf debugging report
   on each IPSec gateway. On a non-Linux FreeS/WAN implementation, gather
   equivalent information. Use this, and the tips in the next sections,
   to troubleshoot. Are you sure that both endpoints are capable of
   hearing and responding to ping?

  3.2 Those pesky configuration errors

   IPSec may be dropping your ping packets since they do not belong in
   the tunnels you have constructed:
     * Your ping may not test the tunnel you intend to test. For details,
       see our[1375] "I can't ping" FAQ.
     * Alternately, you may have a configuration error. For example, you
       may have configured one of the four possible tunnels between two
       gateways, but not the one required to secure the important traffic
       you're now testing. In this case, add and start the tunnel, and
       try again.

   In either case, you will often see a message like:
klipsdebug... no eroute

   which we discuss in[1376] this FAQ.

   Note:
     * [1377]Network Address Translation (NAT) and[1378] IP masquerade
       may have an effect on which tunnels you need to configure.
     * When testing a tunnel that protects a multi-node subnet, try
       several subnet nodes as ping targets, in case one node is routing
       incorrectly.

  3.3 Check Routing and Firewalling

   If you've confirmed your configuration assumptions, the problem is
   almost certainly with routing or firewalling. Isolate the problem
   using interface statistics, firewall statistics, or a packet sniffer.

    Background:

     * Linux FreeS/WAN supplies all the special routing it needs; you
       need only route packets out through your IPSec gateway. Verify
       that on the subnetted machines you are using for your ping-test,
       your routing is as expected. I have seen a tunnel "fail" because
       the subnet machine sending packets out an alternate gateway (not
       our IPSec gateway) on their return path.
     * Linux FreeS/WAN requires particular[1379] firewalling
       considerations. Check the firewall rules on your IPSec gateways
       and ensure that they allow IPSec traffic through. Be sure that no
       other machine - for example a router between the gateways - is
       blocking your IPSec packets.

    View Interface and Firewall Statistics

   Interface reports and firewall statistics can help you track down lost
   packets at a glance. Check any firewall statistics you may be keeping
   on your IPSec gateways, for dropped packets.

   Tip: You can take a snapshot of the packets processed by your firewall
   with:
    iptables -L -n -v

   You can get creative with "diff" to find out what happens to a
   particular packet during transmission.

   Both cat /proc/net/dev and ifconfig display interface statistics, and
   both are included in ipsec barf. Use either to check if any interface
   has dropped packets. If you find that one has, test whether this is
   related to your ping. While you ping continuously, print that
   interface's statistics several times. Does its drop count increase in
   proportion to the ping? If so, check why the packets are dropped
   there.

   To do this, look at the firewall rules that apply to that interface.
   If the interface is an IPSec interface, more information may be
   available in the log. Grep for the word "drop" in a log which was
   created with klipsdebug=all as the error happened.

   See also this[1380] discussion on interpreting ifconfig statistics.

  3.4 When in doubt, sniff it out

   If you have checked configuration assumptions, routing, and firewall
   rules, and your interface statistics yield no clue, it remains for you
   to investigate the mystery of the lost packet by the most thorough
   method: with a packet sniffer (providing, of course, that this is
   legal where you are working).

   In order to detect packets on the ipsec virtual interfaces, you will
   need an up-to-date sniffer (tcpdump, ethereal, ksnuffle) on your IPSec
   gateway machines. You may also find it useful to sniff the ping
   endpoints.

    Anticipate your packets' path

   Ping, and examine each interface along the projected path, checking
   for your ping's arrival. If it doesn't get to the the next stop, you
   have narrowed down where to look for it. In this way, you can isolate
   a problem area, and narrow your troubleshooting focus.

   Within a machine running Linux FreeS/WAN, this[1381] packet flow
   diagram will help you anticipate a packet's path.

   Note that:
     * from the perspective of the tunneled packet, the entire tunnel is
       one hop. That's explained in[1382] this FAQ.
     * an encapsulated IPSec packet will look different, when sniffed,
       from the plaintext packet which generated it. You can see
       plaintext packets entering an IPSec interface and the resulting
       cyphertext packets as they emerge from the corresponding physical
       interface.

   Once you isolate where the packet is lost, take a closer look at
   firewall rules, routing and configuration assumptions as they affect
   that specific area. If the packet is lost on an IPSec gateway, comb
   through klipsdebug output for anomalies.

   If the packet goes through both gateways successfully and reaches the
   ping target, but does not return, suspect routing. Check that the ping
   target routes packets back to the IPSec gateway.

  3.5 Check your logs

   Here, too, log information can be useful. Start with the[1383]
   guidelines above.

   For connection use problems, set klipsdebug=all. Note that you must
   have enabled the klipsdebug[1384] compile-time option to do this.
   Restart Linux FreeS/WAN so that it rereads ipsec.conf, then recreate
   the error condition. When searching through klipsdebug data, look
   especially for the keywords "drop" (as in dropped packets) and
   "error".

   Often the problem with connection use is not software error, but
   rather that the software is behaving contrary to expectation.

    Interpreting log text

   To interpret the Linux FreeS/WAN log text you've found, use the same
   resources as indicated for troubleshooting connection
   negotiation:[1385] the FAQ , our[1386] background document, and
   the[1387] list archives. Looking in the KLIPS code is only for the
   very brave.

   If you are still stuck, send a[1388] detailed problem report to the
   users' list.

  3.6 More testing for the truly thorough

    Large Packets

   If each of your connections passed the ping test, you may wish to test
   by pinging with large packets (2000 bytes or larger). If it does not
   return, suspect MTU issues, and see this[1389] discussion.

    Stress Tests

   In most users' view, a simple ping test, and perhaps a large-packet
   ping test suffice to indicate a working IPSec connection.

   Some people might like to do additional stress tests prior to
   production use. They may be interested in this[1390] testing protocol
   we use at interoperation conferences, aka "bakeoffs". We also have a
   testing directory that ships with the release.

4. Problem Reporting

  4.1 How to ask for help

   Ask for troubleshooting help on the users' mailing list,[1391]
   users@lists.freeswan.org. While sometimes an initial query with a
   quick description of your intent and error will twig someone's memory
   of a similar problem, it's often necessary to send a second mail with
   a complete problem report.

   When reporting problems to the mailing list(s), please include:
     * a brief description of the problem
     * if it's a compile problem, the actual output from make, showing
       the problem. Try to edit it down to only the relevant part, but
       when in doubt, be as complete as you can. If it's a kernel compile
       problem, any relevant out.* files
     * if it's a run-time problem, pointers to where we can find the
       complete output from "ipsec barf" from BOTH ENDS (not just one of
       them). Remember that it's common outside the US and Canada to pay
       for download volume, so if you can't post barfs on the web and
       send the URL to the mailing list, at least compress them with tar
       or gzip.
       If you can, try to simplify the case that is causing the problem.
       In particular, if you clear your logs, start FreeS/WAN with no
       other connections running, cause the problem to happen, and then
       do ipsec barf on both ends immediately, that gives the smallest
       and least cluttered output.
     * any other error messages, complaints, etc. that you saw. Please
       send the complete text of the messages, not just a summary.
     * what your network setup is. Include subnets, gateway addresses,
       etc. A schematic diagram is a good format for this information.
     * exactly what you were trying to do with Linux FreeS/WAN, and
       exactly what went wrong
     * a fix, if you have one. But remember, you are sending mail to
       people all over the world; US residents and US citizens in
       particular, please read doc/exportlaws.html before sending code --
       even small bug fixes -- to the list or to us.
     * When in doubt about whether to include some seemingly-trivial item
       of information, include it. It is rare for problem reports to have
       too much information, and common for them to have too little.

   Here are some good general guidelines on bug reporting:[1392] How To
   Ask Questions The Smart Way and[1393] How to Report Bugs Effectively.

  4.2 Where to ask

   To report a problem, send mail about it to the users' list. If you are
   certain that you have found a bug, report it to the bugs list. If you
   encounter a problem while doing your own coding on the Linux FreeS/WAN
   codebase and think it is of interest to the design team, notify the
   design list. When in doubt, default to the users' list. More
   information about the mailing lists is found[1394] here.

   For a number of reasons -- including export-control regulations
   affecting almost any private discussion of encryption software -- we
   prefer that problem reports and discussions go to the lists, not
   directly to the team. Beware that the list goes worldwide; US
   citizens, read this important information about your[1395] export
   laws. If you're using this software, you really should be on the
   lists. To get onto them, visit[1396] lists.freeswan.org.

   If you do send private mail to our coders or want a private reply from
   them, please make sure that the return address on your mail (From or
   Reply-To header) is a valid one. They have more important things to do
   than to unravel addresses that have been mangled in an attempt to
   confuse spammers.

5. Additional Notes on Troubleshooting

   The following sections supplement the Guide:[1397] information
   available on your system;[1398] testing between security
   gateways;[1399] ifconfig reports for KLIPS debugging;[1400] using GDB
   on Pluto.

  5.1 Information available on your system

    Logs used

   Linux FreeS/WAN logs to:
     * /var/log/secure (or, on Debian, /var/log/auth.log)
     * /var/log/messages

   Check both places to get full information. If you find nothing, check
   your syslogd.conf(5) to see where your /etc/syslog.conf or equivalent
   is directing authpriv messages.

    man pages provided

   [1401]ipsec.conf(5)
          Manual page for IPSEC configuration file.

   [1402]ipsec(8)
          Primary man page for ipsec utilities.

   Other man pages are on[1403] this list and in
     * /usr/local/man/man3
     * /usr/local/man/man5
     * /usr/local/man/man8/ipsec_*

    Status information

   ipsec auto --status
          Command to get status report from running system. Displays
          Pluto's state. Includes the list of connections which are
          currently "added" to Pluto's internal database; lists state
          objects reflecting ISAKMP and IPsec SAs being negotiated or
          installed.

   ipsec look
          Brief status info.

   ipsec barf
          Copious debugging info.

  5.2 Testing between security gateways

   Sometimes you need to test a subnet-subnet tunnel. This is a tunnel
   between two security gateways, which protects traffic on behalf of the
   subnets behind these gateways. On this network:
     Sunset==========West------------------East=========Sunrise
                     IPSec gateway         IPSec gateway
           local net       untrusted net       local net

   you might name this tunnel sunset-sunrise. You can test this tunnel by
   having a machine behind one gateway ping a machine behind the other
   gateway, but this is not always convenient or even possible.

   Simply pinging one gateway from the other is not useful. Such a ping
   does not normally go through the tunnel. The tunnel handles traffic
   between the two protected subnets, not between the gateways .
   Depending on the routing in place, a ping might
     * either succeed by finding an unencrypted route
     * or fail by finding no route. Packets without an IPSEC eroute are
       discarded.

   Neither event tells you anything about the tunnel. You can explicitly
   create an eroute to force such packets through the tunnel, or you can
   create additional tunnels as described in our[1404] configuration
   document, but those may be unnecessary complications in your
   situation.

   The trick is to explicitly test between both gateways' private-side IP
   addresses. Since the private-side interfaces are on the protected
   subnets, the resulting packets do go via the tunnel. Use either ping
   -I or traceroute -i, both of which allow you to specify a source
   interface. (Note: unsupported on older Linuxes). The same principles
   apply for a road warrior (or other) case where only one end of your
   tunnel is a subnet.

  5.3 ifconfig reports for KLIPS debugging

   When diagnosing problems using ifconfig statistics, you may wonder
   what type of activity increments a particular counter for an ipsecN
   device. Here's an index, posted by KLIPS developer Richard Guy Briggs:
Here is a catalogue of the types of errors that can occur for which
statistics are kept when transmitting and receiving packets via klips.
I notice that they are not necessarily logged in the right counter.
. . .

Sources of ifconfig statistics for ipsec devices

rx-errors:
- packet handed to ipsec_rcv that is not an ipsec packet.
- ipsec packet with payload length not modulo 4.
- ipsec packet with bad authenticator length.
- incoming packet with no SA.
- replayed packet.
- incoming authentication failed.
- got esp packet with length not modulo 8.

tx_dropped:
- cannot process ip_options.
- packet ttl expired.
- packet with no eroute.
- eroute with no SA.
- cannot allocate sk_buff.
- cannot allocate kernel memory.
- sk_buff internal error.


The standard counters are:

struct enet_statistics
{
        int        rx_packets;                /* total packets received */
        int        tx_packets;                /* total packets transmitted */
        int        rx_errors;                /* bad packets received */
        int        tx_errors;                /* packet transmit problems */
        int        rx_dropped;                /* no space in linux buffers */
        int        tx_dropped;                /* no space available in linux */
        int        multicast;                /* multicast packets received */
        int        collisions;

        /* detailed rx_errors: */
        int        rx_length_errors;
        int        rx_over_errors;                /* receiver ring buff overflo
w */
        int        rx_crc_errors;                /* recved pkt with crc error *
/
        int        rx_frame_errors;        /* recv'd frame alignment error */
        int        rx_fifo_errors;                /* recv'r fifo overrun */
        int        rx_missed_errors;        /* receiver missed packet */

        /* detailed tx_errors */
        int        tx_aborted_errors;
        int        tx_carrier_errors;
        int        tx_fifo_errors;
        int        tx_heartbeat_errors;
        int        tx_window_errors;
};

of which I think only the first 6 are useful.

  5.4 Using GDB on Pluto

   You may need to use the GNU debugger, gdb(1), on Pluto. This should be
   necessary only in unusual cases, for example if you encounter a
   problem which the Pluto developer cannot readily reproduce or if you
   are modifying Pluto.

   Here are the Pluto developer's suggestions for doing this:
Can you get a core dump and use gdb to find out what Pluto was doing
when it died?

To get a core dump, you will have to set dumpdir to point to a
suitable directory (see [1405]ipsec.conf(5)).

To get gdb to tell you interesting stuff:
        $ script
        $ cd dump-directory-you-chose
        $ gdb /usr/local/lib/ipsec/pluto core
        (gdb) where
        (gdb) quit
        $ exit

The resulting output will have been captured by the script command in
a file called "typescript".  Send it to the list.

Do not delete the core file.  I may need to ask you to print out some
more relevant stuff.

   Note that the dumpdir parameter takes effect only when the IPsec
   subsystem is restarted -- reboot or ipsec setup restart.
     _________________________________________________________________

                      Linux FreeS/WAN Compatibility Guide

   Much of this document is quoted directly from the Linux
   FreeS/WAN[1406] mailing list. Thanks very much to the community of
   testers, patchers and commenters there, especially the ones quoted
   below but also various contributors we haven't quoted.

Implemented parts of the IPsec Specification

   In general, do not expect Linux FreeS/WAN to do everything yet. This
   is a work-in-progress and some parts of the IPsec specification are
   not yet implemented.

  In Linux FreeS/WAN

   Things we do, as of version 1.96:
     * key management methods

        manually keyed
                using keys stored in /etc/ipsec.conf

        automatically keyed
                Automatically negotiating session keys as required. All
                connections are automatically re-keyed periodically.
                The[1407] Pluto daemon implements this using the[1408]
                IKE protocol.

     * Methods of authenticating gateways for IKE

        shared secrets
                stored in[1409] ipsec.secrets(5)

        [1410]RSA signatures
                For details, see[1411] pluto(8) .

        looking up RSA authentication keys from[1412] DNS.
                Note that this technique cannot be fully secure
                until[1413] secure DNS is widely deployed.

     * groups for[1414] Diffie-Hellman key negotiation

        group 2, modp 1024-bit
        group 5, modp 1536-bit
                We implement these two groups.

                In negotiating a keying connection (ISAKMP SA, Phase 1)
                we propose both groups when we are the initiator, and
                accept either when a peer proposes them. Once the keying
                connection is made, we propose only the alternative
                agreed there for data connections (IPsec SA's, Phase 2)
                negotiated over that keying connection.

     * encryption transforms

        [1415]DES
                DES is in the source code since it is needed to implement
                3DES, but single DES is not made available to users
                because[1416] DES is insecure.

        [1417]Triple DES
                implemented, and used as the default encryption in Linux
                FreeS/WAN.

     * authentication transforms

        [1418]HMAC using[1419] MD5
                implemented, may be used in IKE or by by AH or ESP
                transforms.

        [1420]HMAC using[1421] SHA
                implemented, may be used in IKE or by AH or ESP
                transforms.

       In negotiations, we propose both of these and accept either.
     * compression transforms

        IPComp
                IPComp as described in RFC 2393 was added for FreeS/WAN
                1.6. Note that Pluto becomes confused if you ask it to do
                IPComp when the kernel cannot.

   All combinations of implemented transforms are supported. Note that
   some form of packet-level authentication is required whenever
   encryption is used. Without it, the encryption will not be secure.

  Deliberately omitted

   We do not implement everything in the RFCs because some of those
   things are insecure. See our discussions of avoiding[1422] bogus
   security.

   Things we deliberately omit which are required in the RFCs are:
     * null encryption (to use ESP as an authentication-only service)
     * single DES
     * DH group 1, a 768-bit modp group

   Since these are the only encryption algorithms and DH group the RFCs
   require, it is possible in theory to have a standards-conforming
   implementation which will not interpoperate with FreeS/WAN. Such an
   implementation would be inherently insecure, so we do not consider
   this a problem.

   Anyway, most implementations sensibly include more secure options as
   well, so dropping null encryption, single DES and Group 1 does not
   greatly hinder interoperation in practice.

   We also do not implement some optional features allowed by the RFCs:
     * aggressive mode for negotiation of the keying channel or ISAKMP
       SA. This mode is a little faster than main mode, but exposes more
       information to an eavesdropper.

   In theory, this should cause no interoperation problems since all
   implementations are required to support the more secure main mode,
   whether or not they also allow aggressive mode.

   In practice, it does sometimes produce problems with implementations
   such as Windows 2000 where aggressive mode is the default. Typically,
   these are easily solved with a configuration change that overrides
   that default.

  Not (yet) in Linux FreeS/WAN

   Things we don't yet do, as of version 1.96:
     * key management methods
          + authenticate key negotiations via local[1423] PKI server, but
            see links to user[1424] patches
          + authenticate key negotiations via[1425] secure DNS
          + unauthenticated key management, using[1426] Diffie-Hellman
            key agreement protocol without authentication. Arguably, this
            would be worth doing since it is secure against all passive
            attacks. On the other hand, it is vulnerable to an
            active[1427] man-in-the-middle attack.
     * encryption transforms
       Currently[1428] Triple DES is the only encryption method Pluto
       will negotiate.
       No additional encryption transforms are implemented, though the
       RFCs allow them and some other IPsec implementations support
       various of them. We are not eager to add more. See this[1429] FAQ
       question.
       [1430]AES, the successor to the DES standard, is an excellent
       candidate for inclusion in FreeS/WAN, see links to user[1431]
       patches.
     * authentication transforms
       No optional additional authentication transforms are currently
       implemented. Likely[1432] SHA-256, SHA-384 and SHA-512 will be
       added when AES is.
     * Policy checking on decrypted packets
       To fully comply with the RFCs, it is not enough just to accept
       only packets which survive any firewall rules in place to limit
       what IPsec packets get in, and then pass KLIPS authentication.
       That is what FreeS/WAN currently does.
       We should also apply additional tests, for example ensuring that
       all packets emerging from a particular tunnel have source and
       destination addresses that fall within the subnets defined for
       that tunnel, and that packets with those addresses that did not
       emerge from the appropriate tunnel are disallowed.
       This will be done as part of a KLIPS rewrite. See these[1433]
       links and the[1434] design mailing list for discussion.

Our PF-Key implementation

   We use PF-key Version Two for communication between the KLIPS kernel
   code and the Pluto Daemon. PF-Key v2 is defined by[1435] RFC 2367.

   The "PF" stands for Protocol Family. PF-Inet defines a
   kernel/userspace interface for the TCP/IP Internet protocols (TCP/IP),
   and other members of the PF series handle Netware, Appletalk, etc.
   PF-Key is just a PF for key-related matters.

  PF-Key portability

   PF-Key came out of Berkeley Unix work and is used in the various BSD
   IPsec implementations, and in Solaris. This means there is some hope
   of porting our Pluto(8) to one of the BSD distributions, or of running
   their photurisd(8) on Linux if you prefer[1436] Photuris key
   management over IKE.

   It is, however, more complex than that. The PK-Key RFC deliberately
   deals only with keying, not policy management. The three PF-Key
   implementations we have looked at -- ours, OpenBSD and KAME -- all
   have extensions to deal with security policy, and the extensions are
   different. There have been discussions aimed at sorting out the
   differences, perhaps for a version three PF-Key spec. All players are
   in favour of this, but everyone involved is busy and it is not clear
   whether or when these discussions might bear fruit.

Kernels other than the latest 2.2.x and 2.4.y

   We develop and test on Redhat Linux using the most recent kernel in
   the 2.2 and 2.4 series. In general, we recommend you use the latest
   kernel in one of those series. Complications and caveats are discussed
   below.

  2.0.x kernels

   Consider upgrading to the 2.2 kernel series. If you want to stay with
   the 2.0 series, then we strongly recommend 2.0.39. Some useful
   security patches were added in 2.0.38.

   Various versions of the code have run at various times on most 2.0.xx
   kernels, but the current version is only lightly tested on 2.0.39, and
   not at all on older kernels.

   Some of our patches for older kernels are shipped in 2.0.37 and later,
   so they are no longer provided in FreeS/WAN. This means recent
   versions of FreeS/WAN will probably not compile on anything earlier
   than 2.0.37.

  2.2 and 2.4 kernels

   FreeS/WAN 1.0
          ran only on 2.0 kernels

   FreeS/WAN 1.1 to 1.8
          ran on 2.0 or 2.2 kernels
          ran on some development kernels, 2.3 or 2.4-test

   FreeS/WAN 1.9 to 1.96
          runs on 2.0, 2.2 or 2.4 kernels

   In general, we suggest the latest 2.2 kernel or 2.4 for production
   use.

   Of course no release can be guaranteed to run on kernels more recent
   than it is, so quite often there will be no stable FreeS/WAN for the
   absolute latest kernel. See the[1437] FAQ for discussion.

Intel Linux distributions other than Redhat

   We develop and test on Redhat 6.1 for 2.2 kernels, and on Redhat 7.1
   or 7.2 for 2.4, so minor changes may be required for other
   distributions.

  Redhat 7.0

   There are some problems with FreeS/WAN on Redhat 7.0. They are
   soluble, but we recommend you upgrade to a later Redhat instead..

   Redhat 7 ships with two compilers.
     * Their gcc is version 2.96. Various people, including the GNU
       compiler developers and Linus, have said fairly emphatically that
       using this was a mistake. 2.96 is a development version, not
       intended for production use. In particular, it will not compile a
       Linux kernel.
     * Redhat therefore also ship a separate compiler, which they call
       kgcc, for compiling kernels.

   Kernel Makefiles have gcc as a default, and must be adjusted to use
   kgcc before a kernel will compile on 7.0. This mailing list message
   gives details:

cd to /usr/src/linux and open the Makefile in your favorite editor. You
will need to look for a line similar to this:

CC = $(CROSS_COMPILE)gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I$(HPATH)

This line specifies which C compiler to use to build the kernel. It should
be changed to:

CC = $(CROSS_COMPILE)kgcc -D__KERNEL__ -I$(HPATH)

for Red Hat Linux 7. The kgcc compiler is egcs 2.91.66. From here you can
proceed with the typical compiling steps.

  SuSE Linux

   SuSE 6.3 and later versions, at least in Europe, ship with FreeS/WAN
   included.

   FreeS/WAN packages distributed for SuSE 7.0-7.2 were somehow
   miscompiled. You can find fixed packages on[1439] Kurt Garloff's page.

   Here are some notes for an earlier SuSE version.

    SuSE Linux 5.3

Date: Mon, 30 Nov 1998
From: Peter Onion <ponion@srd.bt.co.uk>

... I got Saturdays snapshot working between my two SUSE5.3 machines at home.

The mods to the install process are quite simple.  From memory and looking at
the files on the SUSE53 machine here at work....

And extra link in each of the /etc/init.d/rc?.d directories called K35ipsec
which SUSE use to shut a service down.

A few mods in /etc/init.d/ipsec  to cope with the different places that SUSE
put config info, and remove the inculsion of /etc/rc.d/init.d/functions and .
/etc/sysconfig/network as they don't exists and 1st one isn't needed anyway.

insert ". /etc/rc.config" to pick up the SUSE config info and use

  if test -n "$NETCONFIG" -a "$NETCONFIG" != "YAST_ASK" ; then

to replace

  [ ${NETWORKING} = "no" ] && exit 0

Create /etc/sysconfig  as SUSE doesn't have one.

I think that was all (but I prob forgot something)....

   You may also need to fiddle initialisation scripts to ensure that
   /var/run/pluto.pid is removed when rebooting. If this file is present,
   Pluto does not come up correctly.

The only trick to getting it up is that on the slackware dist there is no
init.d directory in /etc/rc.d .. so create one.  Then, what I do is take the
IPsec startup script which normally gets put into the init.d directory, and
put it in /etc/rc.d and name ir rc.ipsec .. then I symlink it to the file
in init.d.  The only file in the dist you need to really edit is the
utils/Makefile, setup4:

Everything else should be just fine.

I have successfully installed FreeS/WAN on several Slackware 7.1 machines.
FreeS/WAN installed its rc.ipsec file in /etc/rc.d.  I had to manually call

Brewer's.

  Debian

   A recent (Nov 2001) mailing list points to a[1440] web page on setting
   up several types of tunnel, including IPsec, on Debian.

        Compiled and installed without error on a Debian 2.1 system
with kernel-source-2.0.36 after pointing RCDIR in utils/Makefile to
/etc/init.d.

        /var/lock/subsys/ doesn't exist on Debian boxen, needs to be
created; not a fatal error.

        Finally, IPsec scripts appear to be dependant on GNU awk
(gawk); the default Debian awk (mawk-1.3.3-2) had fatal difficulties.
With gawk installed and /etc/alternatives/awk linked to /usr/bin/gawk
operation appears flawless.

   The scripts in question have been modified since this was posted. Awk

  Yellow Dog Linux on Power PC

Subject:  Compiling FreeS/WAN 1.1 on YellowDog Linux (PPC)
   Date:  11 Dec 1999
   From:  Darron Froese <darron@fudgehead.com>

I'm summarizing here for the record - because it's taken me many hours to do
this (multiple times) and because I want to see IPsec on more linuxes than
just x86.

Also, I can't remember if I actually did summarize it before... ;-) I'm
working too many late hours.

That said - here goes.

1. Get your linux kernel and unpack into /usr/src/linux/ - I used 2.2.13.
<http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.2/linux-2.2.13.tar.bz2>

2. Get FreeS/WAN and unpack into /usr/src/freeswan-1.1
<ftp://ftp.xs4all.nl/pub/crypto/freeswan/freeswan-1.1.tar.gz>

3. Get the gmp src rpm from here:
<ftp://ftp.yellowdoglinux.com//pub/yellowdog/champion-1.1/SRPMS/SRPMS/gmp-2.0.2
-9a.src.rpm>

4. Su to root and do this: rpm --rebuild gmp-2.0.2-9a.src.rpm

You will see a lot of text fly by and when you start to see the rpm
recompiling like this:

Executing: %build
+ umask 022
+ cd /usr/src/redhat/BUILD
+ cd gmp-2.0.2
+ libtoolize --copy --force
Remember to add `AM_PROG_LIBTOOL' to `configure.in'.
You should add the contents of `/usr/share/aclocal/libtool.m4' to
`aclocal.m4'.
+ CFLAGS=-O2 -fsigned-char
+ ./configure --prefix=/usr

Hit Control-C to stop the rebuild. NOTE: We're doing this because for some
reason the gmp source provided with FreeS/WAN 1.1 won't build properly on
ydl.

cd /usr/src/redhat/BUILD/
cp -ar gmp-2.0.2 /usr/src/freeswan-1.1/
cd /usr/src/freeswan-1.1/
rm -rf gmp
mv gmp-2.0.2 gmp

5. Open the freeswan Makefile and change the line that says:
KERNEL=$(b)zimage (or something like that) to
KERNEL=vmlinux

6. cd ../linux/

7. make menuconfig
Select an option or two and then exit - saving your changes.

8. cd ../freeswan-1.1/ ; make menugo

That will start the whole process going - once that's finished compiling,
you have to install your new kernel and reboot.

That should build FreeS/WAN on ydl (I tried it on 1.1).

The PowerMac G3 can run YDL 1.1 just fine. It should also be able to run
FreeS/WAN 1.2patch1 with a couple minor modifications:

1. In the Makefile it specifies a bzimage for the kernel compile - you have
to change that to vmlinux for the PPC.

2. The gmp source that comes with FreeS/WAN (for whatever reason) fails to
compile. I have gotten around this by getting the gmp src rpm from here:

ftp://ftp.yellowdoglinux.com//pub/yellowdog/champion-1.1/SRPMS/SRPMS/gmp-2.0.2-
9a.src.rpm

If you rip the source out of there - and place it where the gmp source
resides it will compile just fine.

   FreeS/WAN no longer includes GMP source.

I have a question, before I make up some patches. I need to hack
gmp/mpn/powerpc32/*.s to build them. Is this ok? The changes are
trivial, but could I also use a different version of gmp? Is it vanilla
here?

I guess my only real headache is from ipchains, which appears to stop
running when IPsec has been started for a while. This is with 2.2.14 on
sparc.

1 mbit / sec rate.......  they put a Hi/Fn 7901 hardware encryption

encryption........ pretty significant increase if you ask me.

Multiprocessor machines

   FreeS/WAN is designed to work on SMP (symmetric multi-processing)
   Linux machines and is regularly tested on dual processor x86 machines.

   We do not know of any testing on multi-processor machines with other
   CPU architectures or with more than two CPUs. Anyone who does test
   this, please report results to the[1444] mailing list .

   The current design does not make particularly efficient use of
   multiprocessor machines; some of the kernel work is single-threaded.

Support for crypto hardware

   Supporting hardware cryptography accelerators has not been a high
   priority for the development team because it raises a number of fairly
   complex issues:
     * Can you trust the hardware? If it is not Open Source, how do you
       audit its security? Even if it is, how do you check that the
       design has no concealed traps?
     * If an interface is added for such hardware, can that interface be
       subverted or misused?
     * Is hardware acceleration actually a performance win? It clearly is
       in many cases, but on a fast machine it might be better to use the
       CPU for the encryption than to pay the overheads of moving data to
       and from a crypto board.
     * the current KLIPS code does not provide a clean interface for
       hardware accelerators

   That said, we have a[1445] report of FreeS/WAN working with one crypto
   accelerator and some work is going on to modify KLIPS to create a
   clean generic interface to such products. See this[1446] web page for
   some of the design discussion.

   More recently, a patch to support some hardware accelerators has been
   posted:

Here's a web site with H/W acceleration patch for FreeS/WAN 1.91, including
S/W and Hifn 7901 crypto support.

http://sources.colubris.com/

Martin Gadbois

   Hardware accelerators could take performance well beyond what
   FreeS/WAN can do in software (discussed[1447] here ). Here is some
   discussion off the IETF IPsec list, October 2001:
 ... Currently shipping chips deliver, 600 mbps throughput on a single
 stream of 3DES IPsec traffic.  There are also chips that use multiple
 cores to do 2.4 gbps.  We (Cavium) and others have announced even faster
 chips. ... Mid 2002 versions will handle at line rate (OC48 and OC192)
 IPsec and SSL/TLS traffic not only 3DES CBC but also AES and arc4.

   The patches to date support chips that have been in production for
   some time, not the state-of-the-art latest-and-greatest devices
   described in that post. However, they may still outperform software
   and they almost certainly reduce CPU overhead.

IP version 6 (IPng)

   The Internet currently runs on version four of the IP protocols. IPv4
   is what is in the standard Linux IP stack, and what FreeS/WAN was
   built for. In IPv4, IPsec is an optional feature.

   The next version of the IP protocol suite is version six, usually
   abbreviated either as "IPv6" or as "IPng" for "IP: the next
   generation". For IPv6, IPsec is a required feature. Any machine doing
   IPv6 is required to support IPsec, much as any machine doing (any
   version of) IP is required to support ICMP.

   There is a Linux implementation of IPv6 in Linux kernels 2.2 and
   above. For details, see the[1448] FAQ. It does not yet support IPsec.
   The[1449] USAGI project are also working on IPv6 for Linux.

   FreeS/WAN was originally built for the current standard, IPv4, but we
   are interested in seeing it work with IPv6. Some progress has been
   made, and a patched version with IPv6 support is[1450] available. For
   more recent information, check the[1451] mailing list.

  IPv6 background

   IPv6 has been specified by an IETF[1452] working group. The group's
   page lists over 30 RFCs to date, and many Internet Drafts as well. The
   overview is[1453] RFC 2460. Major features include:
     * expansion of the address space from 32 to 128 bits,
     * changes to improve support for
          + mobile IP
          + automatic network configuration
          + quality of service routing
          + ...
     * improved security via IPsec

   A number of projects are working on IPv6 implementation. A prominent
   Open Source effort is[1454] KAME, a collaboration among several large
   Japanese companies to implement IPv6 for Berkeley Unix. Other major
   players are also working on IPv6. For example, see pages at:
     * [1455]Sun
     * [1456]Cisco
     * [1457]Microsoft

   The[1458] 6bone (IPv6 backbone) testbed network has been up for some
   time. There is an active[1459] IPv6 user group.

   One of the design goals for IPv6 was that it must be possible to
   convert from v4 to v6 via a gradual transition process. Imagine the
   mess if there were a "flag day" after which the entire Internet used
   v6, and all software designed for v4 stopped working. Almost every
   computer on the planet would need major software changes! There would
   be huge costs to replace older equipment. Implementers would be worked
   to death before "the day", systems administrators and technical
   support would be completely swamped after it. The bugs in every
   implementation would all bite simultaneously. Large chunks of the net
   would almost certainly be down for substantial time periods. ...

   Fortunately, the design avoids any "flag day". It is therefore a
   little tricky to tell how quickly IPv6 will take over. The transition
   has certainly begun. For examples, see announcements from[1460] NTT
   and[1461] Nokia. However, it is not yet clear how quickly the process
   will gain momentum, or when it will be completed. Likely large parts
   of the Internet will remain with IPv4 for years to come.

   The FreeS/WAN project needs you! We rely on the user community to keep
   up to date. Mail users@lists.freeswan.org with your interop success
   stories.

   Please note: Most of our interop examples feature Linux FreeS/WAN 1.x
   config files. You can convert them to 2.x files fairly easily with the
   patch in our[1462] Upgrading Guide.

Basic Interop Rules

   Vanilla FreeS/WAN implements[1504] these parts of the IPSec
   specifications. You can add more with[1505] Super FreeS/WAN, but what
   we offer may be enough for many users.
     * To use X.509 certificates with FreeS/WAN, you will need the[1506]
       X.509 patch or[1507] Super FreeS/WAN , which includes that patch.
     * To use[1508] Network Address Translation (NAT) traversal with
       FreeS/WAN, you will need Arkoon Network Security's[1509] NAT
       traversal patch or[1510] Super FreeS/WAN, which includes it.

   We offer a set of proposals which is not user-adjustable, but covers
   all combinations that we can offer. FreeS/WAN always proposes triple
   DES encryption and Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS). In addition, we
   propose Diffie Hellman groups 5 and 2 (in that order), and MD5 and
   SHA-1 hashes. We accept the same proposals, in the same order of
   preference.

   Other interop notes:
     * A[1511] SHA-1 bug in FreeS/WAN 2.00, 2.01 and 2.02 may affect some
       interop scenarios. It does not affect 1.x versions, and is fixed
       in 2.03 and later.
     * Some other implementations will close a connection with FreeS/WAN
       after some time. This may be a problem with rekey lifetimes.
       Please see[1512] this tip and[1513] this workaround.

       better results with Service Pack 1.
     * The Road Warrior setup works either way round. Windows (XP or 2K)
       IPsec can connect as a Road Warrior to FreeS/WAN. However,
       FreeS/WAN can also successfully connect as a Road Warrior to
       Windows IPsec (see Nate Carlson's configs below).
     * FreeS/WAN version 1.92 or later is required to avoid an
       interoperation problem with Windows native IPsec. Earlier
       FreeS/WAN versions did not process the Commit Bit as Windows
       native IPsec expected.

       uses hex.
     * Raptor's tunnel endpoint may be a host, subnet or group of subnets
       (see[1685] this message ). FreeS/WAN cannot handle the group of
       subnets; you must create separate connections for each in order to
       interoperate.

                           Performance of FreeS/WAN

   The performance of FreeS/WAN is adequate for most applications.

   In normal operation, the main concern is the overhead for encryption,
   decryption and authentication of the actual IPsec ([1732]ESP
   and/or[1733] AH) data packets. Tunnel setup and rekeying occur so much
   less frequently than packet processing that, in general, their
   overheads are not worth worrying about.

   At startup, however, tunnel setup overheads may be significant. If you
   reboot a gateway and it needs to establish many tunnels, expect some
   delay. This and other issues for large gateways are discussed[1734]
   below.

Published material

   The University of Wales at Aberystwyth has done quite detailed speed
   tests and put[1735] their results on the web.

   Davide Cerri's[1736] thesis (in Italian) includes performance results
   for FreeS/WAN and for[1737] TLS. He posted an[1738] English summary on
   the mailing list.

   Steve Bellovin used one of AT&T Research's FreeS/WAN gateways as his
   data source for an analysis of the cache sizes required for key
   swapping in IPsec. Available as[1739] text or[1740] PDF slides for a
   talk on the topic.

   See also the NAI work mentioned in the next section.

Estimating CPU overheads

   We can come up with a formula that roughly relates CPU speed to the
   rate of IPsec processing possible. It is far from exact, but should be
   usable as a first approximation.

   An analysis of authentication overheads for high-speed networks,
   including some tests using FreeS/WAN, is on the[1741] NAI Labs site.
   In particular, see figure 3 in this[1742] PDF document. Their
   estimates of overheads, measured in Pentium II cycles per byte
   processed are:

                              IPsec authentication encryption cycles/byte
      Linux IP stack alone     no         no           no               5
      IPsec without crypto     yes        no           no              11
   IPsec, authentication only  yes      SHA-1          no              24
     IPsec with encryption     yes       yes          yes      not tested

   Overheads for IPsec with encryption were not tested in the NAI work,
   but Antoon Bosselaers'[1743] web page gives cost for his optimised
   Triple DES implementation as 928 Pentium cycles per block, or 116 per
   byte. Adding that to the 24 above, we get 140 cycles per byte for
   IPsec with encryption.

   At 140 cycles per byte, a 140 MHz machine can handle a megabyte -- 8
   megabits -- per second. Speeds for other machines will be proportional
   to this. To saturate a link with capacity C megabits per second, you
   need a machine running at C * 140/8 = C * 17.5 MHz.

   However, that estimate is not precise. It ignores the differences
   between:
     * NAI's test packets and real traffic
     * NAI's Pentium II cycles, Bosselaers' Pentium cycles, and your
       machine's cycles
     * different 3DES implementations
     * SHA-1 and MD5

   and does not account for some overheads you will almost certainly
   have:
     * communication on the client-side interface
     * switching between multiple tunnels -- re-keying, cache reloading
       and so on

   so we suggest using C * 25 to get an estimate with a bit of a built-in
   safety factor.

   This covers only IP and IPsec processing. If you have other loads on
   your gateway -- for example if it is also working as a firewall --
   then you will need to add your own safety factor atop that.

   This estimate matches empirical data reasonably well. For example,
   Metheringham's tests, described[1744] below, show a 733 topping out
   between 32 and 36 Mbit/second, pushing data as fast as it can down a
   100 Mbit link. Our formula suggests you need at least an 800 to handle
   a fully loaded 32 Mbit link. The two results are consistent.

   Some examples using this estimation method:

                       Interface Machine speed in MHz
                               Type Mbit per
                              second Estimate
           Mbit*25 Minimum IPSEC gateway Minimum with other load

                              (e.g. firewall)
        DSL 1 25 MHz whatever you have 133, or better if you have it
                            cable modem 3 75 MHz
    any link, light load 5 125 MHz 133 200+, almost any surplus machine
                Ethernet 10 250 MHz surplus 266 or 300 500+
         fast link, moderate load 20 500 MHz 500 800+, any current
                              off-the-shelf PC
                      T3 or E3 45 1125 MHz 1200 1500+
    fast Ethernet 100 2500 MHz // not feasible with 3DES in software on
                            current machines //
                              OC3 155 3875 MHz

   Such an estimate is far from exact, but should be usable as minimum
   requirement for planning. The key observations are:
     * older surplus machines are fine for IPsec gateways at loads up to
       5 megabits per second or so
     * a mid-range new machine can handle IPsec at rates up to 20
       megabits per second or more

  Higher performance alternatives

   [1745]AES is a new US government block cipher standard, designed to
   replace the obsolete[1746] DES. If FreeS/WAN using[1747] 3DES is not
   fast enough for your application, the AES[1748] patch may help.

   To date (March 2002) we have had only one[1749] mailing list report of
   measurements with the patch applied. It indicates that, at least for
   the tested load on that user's network, AES roughly doubles IPsec
   throughput. If further testing confirms this, it may prove possible to
   saturate an OC3 link in software on a high-end box.

   Also, some work is being done toward support of[1750] hardware IPsec
   acceleration which might extend the range of requirements FreeS/WAN
   could meet.

  Other considerations

   CPU speed may be the main issue for IPsec performance, but of course
   it isn't the only one.

   You need good ethernet cards or other network interface hardware to
   get the best performance. See this[1751] ethernet information page and
   this[1752] Linux network driver page.

   The current FreeS/WAN kernel code is largely single-threaded. It is
   SMP safe, and will run just fine on a multiprocessor machine ([1753]
   discussion), but the load within the kernel is not shared effectively.
   This means that, for example to saturate a T3 -- which needs about a
   1200 MHz machine -- you cannot expect something like a dual 800 to do
   the job.

   On the other hand, SMP machines do tend to share loads well so --
   provided one CPU is fast enough for the IPsec work -- a multiprocessor
   machine may be ideal for a gateway with a mixed load.

Many tunnels from a single gateway

   FreeS/WAN allows a single gateway machine to build tunnels to many
   others. There may, however, be some problems for large numbers as
   indicated in this message from the mailing list:
Subject: Re: Maximum number of ipsec tunnels?

1) "Large" numbers means anything over 50 or so.  I routinely run boxes
with about 200 tunnels.  Once you get more than 50 or so, you need to worry
about several scalability issues:

a) You need to put a "-" sign in syslogd.conf, and rotate the logs daily
not weekly.

b) Processor load per tunnel is small unless the tunnel is not up, in which
case a new half-key gets generated every 90 seconds, which can add up if
you've got a lot of down tunnels.

c) There's other bits of lore you need when running a large number of
tunnels.  For instance, systematically keeping the .conf file free of
conflicts requires tools that aren't shipped with the standard freeswan
package.

d) The pluto startup behavior is quadratic.  With 200 tunnels, this eats up
several minutes at every restart.   I'm told fixes are coming soon.

2) Other than item (1b), the CPU load depends mainly on the size of the
pipe attached, not on the number of tunnels.

   It is worth noting that item (1b) applies only to repeated attempts to
   re-key a data connection (IPsec SA, Phase 2) over an established
   keying connection (ISAKMP SA, Phase 1). There are two ways to reduce
   this overhead using settings in[1754] ipsec.conf(5):
     * set keyingtries to some small value to limit repetitions
     * set keylife to a short time so that a failing data connection will
       be cleaned up when the keying connection is reset.

   The overheads for establishing keying connections (ISAKMP SAs, Phase
   1) are lower because for these Pluto does not perform expensive
   operations before receiving a reply from the peer.

   A gateway that does a lot of rekeying -- many tunnels and/or low
   settings for tunnel lifetimes -- will also need a lot of[1755] random
   numbers from the random(4) driver.

Low-end systems

   Even a 486 can handle a T1 line, according to this mailing list
   message:
Subject: Re: linux-ipsec: IPSec Masquerade
   Date: Fri, 15 Jan 1999 11:13:22 -0500
   From: Michael Richardson

. . . A 486/66 has been clocked by Phil Karn to do
10Mb/s encryption.. that uses all the CPU, so half that to get some CPU,
and you have 5Mb/s. 1/3 that for 3DES and you get 1.6Mb/s....

   and a piece of mail from project technical lead Henry Spencer:
Oh yes, and a new timing point for Sandy's docs...  A P60 -- yes, a 60MHz
Pentium, talk about antiques -- running a host-to-host tunnel to another
machine shows an FTP throughput (that is, end-to-end results with a real
protocol) of slightly over 5Mbit/s either way.  (The other machine is much
faster, the network is 100Mbps, and the ether cards are good ones... so
the P60 is pretty definitely the bottleneck.)

   From the above, and from general user experience as reported on the
   list, it seems clear that a cheap surplus machine -- a reasonable 486,
   a minimal Pentium box, a Sparc 5, ... -- can easily handle a home
   office or a small company connection using any of:
     * ADSL service
     * cable modem
     * T1
     * E1

   If available, we suggest using a Pentium 133 or better. This should
   ensure that, even under maximum load, IPsec will use less than half
   the CPU cycles. You then have enough left for other things you may
   want on your gateway -- firewalling, web caching, DNS and such.

Measuring KLIPS

   Here is some additional data from the mailing list.
Subject: FreeSWAN (specically KLIPS) performance measurements
   Date: Thu, 01 Feb 2001
   From: Nigel Metheringham <Nigel.Metheringham@intechnology.co.uk>

I've spent a happy morning attempting performance tests against KLIPS
(this is due to me not being able to work out the CPU usage of KLIPS so
resorting to the crude measurements of maximum throughput to give a
baseline to work out loading of a box).

Measurements were done using a set of 4 boxes arranged in a line, each
connected to the next by 100Mbit duplex ethernet.  The inner 2 had an
ipsec tunnel between them (shared secret, but I was doing measurements
when the tunnel was up and running - keying should not be an issue
here).  The outer pair of boxes were traffic generators or traffic sink.

The crypt boxes are Compaq DL380s - Uniprocessor PIII/733 with 256K
cache.  They have 128M main memory.  Nothing significant was running on
the boxes other than freeswan.  The kernel was a 2.2.19pre7 patched
with freeswan and ext3.

Without an ipsec tunnel in the chain (ie the 2 inner boxes just being
100BaseT routers), throughput (measured with ttcp) was between 10644
and 11320 KB/sec

With an ipsec tunnel in place, throughput was between 3268 and 3402
KB/sec

These measurements are for data pushed across a TCP link, so the
traffic on the wire between the 2 ipsec boxes would have been higher
than this....

vmstat (run during some other tests, so not affecting those figures) on
the encrypting box shows approx 50% system & 50% idle CPU - which I
don't believe at all.  Interactive feel of the box was significantly
sluggish.

I also tried running the kernel profiler (see man readprofile) during
test runs.

A box doing primarily decrypt work showed basically nothing happening -
I assume interrupts were off.
A box doing encrypt work showed the following:-

Speed with compression

   Another user reported some results for connections with and without IP
   compression:
Subject: [Users] Speed with compression
   Date: Fri, 29 Jun 2001
   From: John McMonagle <johnm@advocap.org>

Did a couple tests with compression using the new 1.91 freeswan.

Running between 2 sites with cable modems.  Both  using approximately
130 mhz pentium.

Transferred files with ncftp.

Compressed file was a 6mb compressed  installation file.
Non compressed was 18mb /var/lib/rpm/packages.rpm

                            Compressed vpn          regular vpn

regular file                110.84 kBs               41.66 kBs

Load  was about 0 either way.
Ping times were very similar  a bit above 9 ms.

Compression looks attractive to me.

   Later in the same thread, project technical lead Henry Spencer added:

> connecting 3 connections, one of them with a measly DS1 link...

Run some timing tests with and without, with data and loads representative
of what you expect in production.  That's the definitive way to decide.
If compression is a net loss, then obviously, leave it turned off.  If it
doesn't make much difference, leave it off for simplicity and hence
robustness.  If there's a substantial gain, by all means turn it on.

If both ends support compression and can successfully negotiate a
compressed connection (trivially true if both are FreeS/WAN 1.91), then
the crucial question is CPU cycles.

Compression has some overhead, so one question is whether *your* data
compresses well enough to save you more CPU cycles (by reducing the volume
of data going through CPU-intensive encryption/decryption) than it costs
you.  Last time I ran such tests on data that was reasonably compressible
but not deliberately contrived to be so, this generally was not true --
compression cost extra CPU cycles -- so compression was worthwhile only if
the link, not the CPU, was the bottleneck.  However, that was before the
slow-compression bug was fixed.  I haven't had a chance to re-run those
tests yet, but it sounds like I'd probably see a different result.

   The bug he refers to was a problem with the compression libraries that
   had us using C code, rather than assembler, for compression. It was
   fixed before 1.91.

Methods of measuring

   If you want to measure the loads FreeS/WAN puts on a system, note that
   tools such as top or measurements such as load average are
   more-or-less useless for this. They are not designed to measure
   something that does most of its work inside the kernel.

   Here is a message from FreeS/WAN kernel programmer Richard Guy Briggs
   on this:

It is not running in interrupt handler.  It is in the bottom half.
This is somewhere between user context (careful, this is not
userspace!) and hardware interrupt context.

vmstat seems to do a fairly good job, but use a running tally to get a
good idea.  A one-off call to vmstat gives different numbers than a
running stat.  To do this, put an interval on your vmstat command
line.

Subject: Re: Measuring the CPU usage of Freeswan
   Date: Mon, 29 Jan 2001
   From: Patrick Michael Kane <modus@pr.es.to>

The only truly accurate way to accurately track FreeSWAN CPU usage is to use
a CPU soaker. You run it on an unloaded system as a benchmark, then start up
FreeSWAN and take the difference to determine how much FreeSWAN is eating.
I believe someone has done this in the past, so you may find something in
the FreeSWAN archives.  If not, someone recently posted a URL to a CPU
soaker benchmark tool on linux-kernel.

                               Testing FreeS/WAN

   This document discusses testing FreeS/WAN.

   Not all types of testing are described here. Other parts of the
   documentation describe some tests:

   [1756]installation document
          testing for a successful install

   [1757]configuration document
          basic tests for a working configuration

   [1758]web links document
          General information on tests for interoperability between
          various IPsec implementations. This includes links to several
          test sites.

   [1759]interoperation document.
          More specific information on FreeS/WAN interoperation with
          other implementations.

   [1760]performance document
          performance measurements

   The test setups and procedures described here can also be used in
   other testing, but this document focuses on testing the IPsec
   functionality of FreeS/WAN.

Testing opportunistic connections

   This section teaches you how to test your opportunistically encrypted
   (OE) connections. To set up OE, please see the easy instructions in
   our[1761] quickstart guide.

  Basic OE Test

   This test is for basic OE functionality. For additional tests, keep
   reading.

   Be sure IPsec is running. You can see whether it is with:
    ipsec setup status

   If need be, you can restart it with:
    service ipsec restart

   Load a FreeS/WAN test website from the host on which you're running
   FreeS/WAN. Note: the feds may be watching these sites. Type one of:

   links oetest.freeswan.org
   links oetest.freeswan.nl

   A positive result looks like this:
   You  seem  to  be  connecting  from:  192.0.2.11 which DNS says is:
   gateway.example.com
     _________________________________________________________________


   Status E-route
   OE    enabled    16    192.139.46.73/32    ->    192.0.2.11/32   =>
   tun0x2097@192.0.2.11
   OE    enabled    176    192.139.46.77/32    ->   192.0.2.11/32   =>
   tun0x208a@192.0.2.11

   If you see this, congratulations! Your OE box will now encrypt its own
   traffic whenever it can. If you have difficulty, see our[1762] OE
   troubleshooting tips.

  OE Gateway Test

   If you've set up FreeS/WAN to protect a subnet behind your gateway,
   you'll need to run another simple test, which can be done from a
   machine running any OS. That's right, your Windows box can be
   protected by opportunistic encryption without any FreeS/WAN install or
   configuration on that box. From each protected subnet node , load the
   FreeS/WAN website with:
   links oetest.freeswan.org
   links oetest.freeswan.nl

   A positive result looks like this:
   You  seem  to  be  connecting  from:  192.0.2.98 which DNS says is:
   box98.example.com
     _________________________________________________________________


   Status E-route
   OE    enabled    16    192.139.46.73/32    ->    192.0.2.98/32   =>
   tun0x134ed@192.0.2.11
   OE    enabled    176    192.139.46.77/32    ->   192.0.2.11/32   =>
   tun0x134d2@192.0.2.11

   If you see this, congratulations! Your OE gateway will now encrypt
   traffic for this subnet node whenever it can. If you have difficulty,
   see our[1763] OE troubleshooting tips.

  Additional OE tests

   When testing OE, you will often find it useful to execute this command
   on the FreeS/WAN host:
   ipsec eroute

   If you have established a connection (either for or for a subnet node)
   you will see a result like:
    192.0.2.11/32   -> 192.139.46.73/32  => tun0x149f@192.139.46.38

   Key:

   1. 192.0.2.11/32 Local start point of the protected traffic.
   2. 192.0.2.194/32 Remote end point of the protected traffic.
   3. 192.0.48.38 Remote FreeS/WAN node (gateway or host). May be the
   same as (2).
   4. [not shown] Local FreeS/WAN node (gateway or host), where you've
   produced the output. May be the same as (1).

   For extra assurance, you may wish to use a packet sniffer such
   as[1764] tcpdump to verify that packets are being encrypted. You
   should see output that indicates ESP encrypted data, for example:
    02:17:47.353750 PPPoE  [ses 0x1e12] IP 154: xy.example.com > oetest.freeswa
n.org: ESP(spi=0x87150d16,seq=0x55)

Testing with User Mode Linux

   [1765]User Mode Linux allows you to run Linux as a user process on
   another Linux machine.

   As of 1.92, the distribution has a new directory named testing. It
   contains a collection of test scripts and sample configurations. Using
   these, you can bring up several copies of Linux in user mode and have
   them build tunnels to each other. This lets you do some testing of a
   FreeS/WAN configuration on a single machine.

   You need a moderately well-endowed machine for this to work well. Each
   UML wants about 16 megs of memory by default, which is plenty for
   FreeS/WAN usage. Typical regression testing only occasionally uses as
   many as 4 UMLs. If one is doing nothing else with the machine (in
   particular, not running X on it), then 128 megs and a 500MHz CPU are
   fine.
   Documentation on these scripts is[1766] here. There is also
   documentation on automated testing[1767] here.

Configuration for a testbed network

   A common test setup is to put a machine with dual Ethernet cards in
   between two gateways under test. You need at least five machines; two
   gateways, two clients and a testing machine in the middle.

   The central machine both routes packets and provides a place to run
   diagnostic software for checking IPsec packets. See next section for
   discussion of[1768] using tcpdump(8) for this.

   This makes things more complicated than if you just connected the two
   gateway machines directly to each other, but it also makes your test
   setup much more like the environment you actually use IPsec in. Those
   environments nearly always involve routing, and quite a few apparent
   IPsec failures turn out to be problems with routing or with firewalls
   dropping packets. This approach lets you deal with those problems on
   your test setup.

   What you end up with looks like:

  Testbed network

      subnet a.b.c.0/24
             |
      eth1 = a.b.c.1
         gate1
      eth0 = 192.168.p.1
             |
             |
      eth0 = 192.168.p.2
         route/monitor box
      eth1 = 192.168.q.2
             |
             |
      eth0 = 192.168.q.1
         gate2
      eth1 = x.y.z.1
              |
       subnet x.y.z.0/24
Where p and q are any convenient values that do not interfere with other
routes you may have. The ipsec.conf(5) file then has, among other things:
conn abc-xyz
      left=192.168.p.1
      leftnexthop=192.168.p.2
      right=192.168.q.1
      rightnexthop=192.168.q.2

   Once that works, you can remove the "route/monitor box", and connect
   the two gateways to the Internet. The only parameters in ipsec.conf(5)
   that need to change are the four shown above. You replace them with
   values appropriate for your Internet connection, and change the eth0
   IP addresses and the default routes on both gateways.

   Note that nothing on either subnet needs to change. This lets you test
   most of your IPsec setup before connecting to the insecure Internet.

  Using packet sniffers in testing

   A number of tools are available for looking at packets. We will
   discuss using[1769] tcpdump(8), a common Linux tool included in most
   distributions. Alternatives offerring more-or-less the same
   functionality include:

   [1770]Ethereal
          Several people on our mailing list report a preference for this
          over tcpdump.

   [1771]windump
          a Windows version of tcpdump(8), possibly handy if you have
          Windows boxes in your network

   [1772]Sniffit
          A linux sniffer that we don't know much about. If you use it,
          please comment on our mailing list.

   See also this[1773] index of packet sniffers.

   tcpdump(8) may misbehave if run on the gateways themselves. It is
   designed to look into a normal IP stack and may become confused if you
   ask it to display data from a stack which has IPsec in play.

   At one point, the problem was quite severe. Recent versions of
   tcpdump, however, understand IPsec well enough to be usable on a
   gateway. You can get the latest version from[1774] tcpdump.org.

   Even with a recent tcpdump, some care is required. Here is part of a
   post from Henry on the topic:
> a) data from sunset to sunrise or the other way is not being
> encrypted (I am using tcpdump (ver. 3.4) -x/ping -p to check
> packages)

What *interface* is tcpdump being applied to?  Use the -i option to
control this.  It matters!  If tcpdump is looking at the ipsecN
interfaces, e.g. ipsec0, then it is seeing the packets before they are
encrypted or after they are decrypted, so of course they don't look
encrypted.  You want to have tcpdump looking at the actual hardware
interfaces, e.g. eth0.

Actually, the only way to be *sure* what you are sending on the wire is to
have a separate machine eavesdropping on the traffic.  Nothing you can do
on the machines actually running IPsec is 100% guaranteed reliable in this
area (although tcpdump is a lot better now than it used to be).

   The most certain way to examine IPsec packets is to look at them on
   the wire. For security, you need to be certain, so we recommend doing
   that. To do so, you need a separate sniffer machine located between
   the two gateways. This machine can be routing IPsec packets, but it
   must not be an IPsec gateway. Network configuration for such testing
   is discussed[1775] above.

   Here's another mailing list message with advice on using tcpdump(8):
Subject: RE: [Users] Encrypted???
   Date: Thu, 29 Nov 2001
   From: "Joe Patterson" <jpatterson@asgardgroup.com>

tcpdump -nl -i $EXT-IF proto 50

-nl tells it not to buffer output or resolve names (if you don't do that it
may confuse you by not outputing anything for a while), -i $EXT-IF (replace
with your external interface) tells it what interface to listen on, and
proto 50 is ESP.  Use "proto 51" if for some odd reason you're using AH, and
"udp port 500" if you want to see the isakmp key exchange/tunnel setup
packets.

You can also run `tcpdump -nl -i ipsec0` to see what traffic is on that
virtual interface.  Anything you see there *should* be either encrypted or
dropped (unless you've turned on some strange options in your ipsec.conf
file)

Another very handy thing is ethereal (http://www.ethereal.com/) which runs
on just about anything, has a nice gui interface (or a nice text-based
interface), and does a great job of protocol  breakdown.  For ESP and AH
it'll basically just tell you that there's a packet of that protocol, and
what the spi is, but for isakmp it'll actually show you a lot of the tunnel
setup information (until it gets to the point in the protocol where isakmp
is encrypted....)

Verifying encryption

   The question of how to verify that messages are actually encrypted has
   been extensively discussed on the mailing list. See this[1776] thread.

   If you just want to verify that packets are encrypted, look at them
   with a packet sniffer (see[1777] previous section ) located between
   the gateways. The packets should, except for some of the header
   information, be utterly unintelligible. The output of good encryption
   looks exactly like random noise.

   A packet sniffer can only tell you that the data you looked at was
   encrypted. If you have stronger requirements -- for example if your
   security policy requires verification that plaintext is not leaked
   during startup or under various anomolous conditions -- then you will
   need to devise much more thorough tests. If you do that, please post
   any results or methodological details which your security policy
   allows you to make public.

   You can put recognizable data into ping packets with something like:
        ping -p feedfacedeadbeef 11.0.1.1

   "feedfacedeadbeef" is a legal hexadecimal pattern that is easy to pick
   out of hex dumps.

   For other protocols, you may need to check if you have encrypted data
   or ASCII text. Encrypted data has approximately equal frequencies for
   all 256 possible characters. ASCII text has most characters in the
   printable range 0x20-0x7f, a few control characters less than 0x20,
   and none at all in the range 0x80-0xff. 0x20, space, is a good
   character to look for. In normal English text space occurs about once
   in seven characters, versus about once in 256 for random or encrypted
   data.

   One thing to watch for: the output of good compression, like that of
   good encryption, looks just like random noise. You cannot tell just by
   looking at a data stream whether it has been compressed, encrypted, or
   both. You need a little care not to mistake compressed data for
   encrypted data in your testing.

   Note also that weak encryption also produces random-looking output.
   You cannot tell whether the encryption is strong by looking at the
   output. To be sure of that, you would need to have both the algorithms
   and the implementation examined by experts.

   For IPsec, you can get partial assurance from interoperability tests.
   See our[1778] interop document. When twenty products all claim to
   implement[1779] 3DES, and they all talk to each other, you can be
   fairly sure they have it right. Of course, you might wonder whether
   all the implementers are consipring to trick you or, more plausibly,
   whether some implementations might have "back doors" so they can get
   also it wrong when required.. If you're seriously worried about things
   like that, you need to get the code you use audited (good luck if it
   is not Open Source), or perhaps to talk to a psychiatrist about
   treatments for paranoia.

                      Kernel configuration for FreeS/WAN

   This section lists many of the options available when configuring a
   Linux kernel, and explains how they should be set on a FreeS/WAN IPsec
   gateway.

Not everyone needs to worry about kernel configuration

   Note that in many cases you do not need to mess with these.

   You may have a Linux distribution which comes with FreeS/WAN installed
   (see this[1783] list). In that case, you need not do a FreeS/WAN
   installation or a kernel configuration. Of course, you might still
   want to configure and rebuild your kernel to improve performance or
   security. This can be done with standard tools described in the[1784]
   Kernel HowTo.

   If you need to install FreeS/WAN, then you do need to configure a
   kernel. However, you may choose to do that using the simplest
   procedure:
     * Configure, build and test a kernel for your system before adding
       FreeS/WAN. See the[1785] Kernel HowTo for details. This step
       cannot be skipped . FreeS/WAN needs the results of your
       configuration.
     * Then use FreeS/WAN's make oldgo command. This sets everything
       FreeS/WAN needs and retains your values everywhere else.

   This document is for those who choose to configure their FreeS/WAN
   kernel themselves.

Assumptions and notation

   Help text for most kernel options is included with the kernel files,
   and is accessible from within the configuration utilities. We assume
   you will refer to that, and to the[1786] Kernel HowTo, as necessary.
   This document covers only the FreeS/WAN-specific aspects of the
   problem.

   To avoid duplication, this document section does not cover settings
   for the additional IPsec-related kernel options which become available
   after you have patched your kernel with FreeS/WAN patches. There is
   help text for those available from within the configuration utility.

   We assume a common configuration in which the FreeS/WAN IPsec gateway
   is also doing ipchains(8) firewalling for a local network, and
   possibly masquerading as well.

   Some suggestions below are labelled as appropriate for "a true
   paranoid". By this we mean they may cause inconvenience and it is not
   entirely clear they are necessary, but they appear to be the safest
   choice. Not using them might entail some risk. Of course one suggested
   mantra for security administrators is: "I know I'm paranoid. I wonder
   if I'm paranoid enough."

  Labels used

   Six labels are used to indicate how options should be set. We mark the
   labels with [square brackets]. For two of these labels, you have no
   choice:

   [required]
          essential for FreeS/WAN operation.

   [incompatible]
          incompatible with FreeS/WAN.

   those must be set correctly or FreeS/WAN will not work

   FreeS/WAN should work with any settings of the others, though of
   course not all combinations have been tested. We do label these in
   various ways, but these labels are only suggestions.

   [recommended]
          useful on most FreeS/WAN gateways

   [disable]
          an unwelcome complication on a FreeS/WAN gateway.

   [optional]
          Your choice. We outline issues you might consider.

   [anything]
          This option has no direct effect on FreeS/WAN and related
          tools, so you should be able to set it as you please.

   Of course complexity is an enemy in any effort to build secure
   systems. For maximum security, any feature that can reasonably be
   turned off should be. "If in doubt, leave it out."

Kernel options for FreeS/WAN

   Indentation is based on the nesting shown by 'make menuconfig' with a
   2.2.16 kernel for the i386 architecture.

   Code maturity and level options

        Prompt for development ... code/drivers
                [optional] If this is no, experimental drivers are not
                shown in later menus.

                For most FreeS/WAN work, no is the preferred setting.
                Using new or untested components is too risky for a
                security gateway.

                However, for some hardware (such as the author's network
                cards) the only drivers available are marked
                new/experimental. In such cases, you must enable this
                option or your cards will not appear under "network
                device support". A true paranoid would leave this option
                off and replace the cards.

        Processor type and features
                [anything]

        Loadable module support

              Enable loadable module support
                      [optional] A true paranoid would disable this. An
                      attacker who has root access to your machine can
                      fairly easily install a bogus module that does
                      awful things, provided modules are enabled. A
                      common tool for attackers is a "rootkit", a set of
                      tools the attacker uses once he or she has become
                      root on your system. The kit introduces assorted
                      additional compromises so that the attacker will
                      continue to "own" your system despite most things
                      you might do to recovery the situation. For Linux,
                      there is a tool called[1787] knark which is
                      basically a rootkit packaged as a kernel module.

                      With modules disabled, an attacker cannot install a
                      bogus module. The only way he can achieve the same
                      effects is to install a new kernel and reboot. This
                      is considerably more likely to be noticed.

                      Many FreeS/WAN gateways run with modules enabled.
                      This simplifies some administrative tasks and some
                      ipchains features are available only as modules.
                      Once an enemy has root on your machine your
                      security is nil, so arguably defenses which come
                      into play only in that situation are pointless.

              Set version information ....
                      [optional] This provides a check to prevent loading
                      modules compiled for a different kernel.

              Kernel module loader
                      [disable] It gives little benefit on a typical
                      FreeS/WAN gate and entails some risk.

        General setup
                We list here only the options that matter for FreeS/WAN.

              Networking support
                      [required]

              Sysctl interface
                      [optional] If this option is turned on and the
                      /proc filesystem installed, then you can control
                      various system behaviours by writing to files under
                      /proc/sys. For example:

        echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ipforward

                      turns IP forwarding on.

                      Disabling this option breaks many firewall scripts.
                      A true paranoid would disable it anyway since it
                      might conceivably be of use to an attacker.

        Plug and Play support
                [anything]

        Block devices
                [anything]

        Networking options

              Packet socket
                      [optional] This kernel feature supports tools such
                      as tcpdump(8) which communicate directly with
                      network hardware, bypassing kernel protocols. This
                      is very much a two-edged sword:

                    # such tools can be very useful to the firewall
                      admin, especially during initial testing
                    # should an evildoer breach your firewall, such tools
                      could give him or her a great deal of information
                      about the rest of your network

                      We recommend disabling this option on production
                      gateways.

              Kernel/User netlink socket
                      [optional] Required if you want to use[1788]
                      advanced router features.

              Routing messages
                      [optional]

              Netlink device emulation
                      [optional]

              Network firewalls
                      [recommended] You need this if the IPsec gateway
                      also functions as a firewall.

                      Even if the IPsec gateway is not your primary
                      firewall, we suggest setting this so that you can
                      protect the gateway with at least basic local
                      packet filters.

              Socket filtering
                      [disable] This enables an older filtering
                      interface. We suggest using ipchains(8) instead. To
                      do that, set the "Network firewalls" option just
                      above, and not this one.

              Unix domain sockets
                      [required] These sockets are used for communication
                      between the[1789] ipsec(8) commands and the[1790]
                      ipsec_pluto(8) daemon.

              TCP/IP networking
                      [required]

                    IP: multicasting
                            [anything]

                    IP: advanced router
                            [optional] This gives you policy routing,
                            which some people have used to good advantage
                            in their scripts for FreeS/WAN gateway
                            management. It is not used in our distributed
                            scripts, so not required unless you want it
                            for custom scripts. It requires the[1791]
                            netlink interface between kernel code and the
                            iproute2(8) command.

                    IP: kernel level autoconfiguration
                            [disable] It gives little benefit on a
                            typical FreeS/WAN gate and entails some risk.

                    IP: firewall packet netlink device
                            [disable]

                    IP: transparent proxy support
                            [optional] This is required in some firewall
                            configurations, but should be disabled unless
                            you have a definite need for it.

                    IP: masquerading
                            [optional] Required if you want to use[1792]
                            non-routable private IP addresses for your
                            local network.

                    IP: Optimize as router not host
                            [recommended]

                    IP: tunneling

                    IP: aliasing support
                            [anything]

                    IP: ARP daemon support (EXPERIMENTAL)
                            Not required on most systems, but might prove
                            useful on heavily-loaded gateways.

                    IP: TCP syncookie support
                            [recommended] It provides a defense against
                            a[1793] denial of service attack which uses
                            bogus TCP connection requests to waste
                            resources on the victim machine.

                    IP: Reverse ARP

                    IP: large window support
                            [recommended] unless you have less than 16
                            meg RAM

              IPv6
                      [optional] FreeS/WAN does not currently support
                      IPv6, though work on integrating FreeS/WAN with the
                      Linux IPv6 stack has begun.[1794] Details.

                      It should be possible to use IPv4 FreeS/WAN on a
                      machine which also does IPv6. This combination is
                      not yet well tested. We would be quite interested
                      in hearing results from anyone expermenting with
                      it, via the[1795] mailing list.

                      We do not recommend using IPv6 on production
                      FreeS/WAN gateways until more testing has been
                      done.

              Novell IPX
                      [disable]

              Appletalk
                      [disable] Quite a few Linux installations use IP
                      but also have some other protocol, such as
                      Appletalk or IPX, for communication with local
                      desktop machines. In theory it should be possible
                      to configure IPsec for the IP side of things
                      without interfering with the second protocol.

                      We do not recommend this. Keep the software on your
                      gateway as simple as possible. If you need a
                      Linux-based Appletalk or IPX server, use a separate
                      machine.

        Telephony support
                [anything]

        SCSI support
                [anything]

        I2O device support
                [anything]

        Network device support
                [anything] should work, but there are some points to
                note.

                The development team test almost entirely on 10 or 100
                megabit Ethernet and modems. In principle, any device
                that can do IP should be just fine for IPsec, but in the
                real world any device that has not been well-tested is
                somewhat risky. By all means try it, but don't bet your
                project on it until you have solid test results.

                If you disabled experimental drivers in the[1796] Code
                maturity section above, then those drivers will not be
                shown here. Check that option before going off to hunt
                for missing drivers.

                If you want Linux to automatically find more than one
                ethernet interface at boot time, you need to:

               o compile the appropriate driver(s) into your kernel.
                 Modules will not work for this
               o add a line such as
   append="ether=0,0,eth0 ether=0,0,eth1"
                 to your /etc/lilo.conf file. In some cases you may need
                 to specify parameters such as IRQ or base address. The
                 example uses "0,0" for these, which tells the system to
                 search. If the search does not succeed on your hardware,
                 then you should retry with explicit parameters. See the
                 lilo.conf(5) man page for details.
               o run lilo(8)

                Having Linux find the cards this way is not necessary,
                but is usually more convenient than loading modules in
                your boot scripts.

        Character devices
                The only required character device is:

              random(4)
                      [required] This is a source of[1797] random numbers
                      which are required for many cryptographic
                      protocols, including several used in IPsec.

                      If you are comfortable with C source code, it is
                      likely a good idea to go in and adjust the #define
                      lines in /usr/src/linux/drivers/char/random.c to
                      ensure that all sources of randomness are enabled.
                      Relying solely on keyboard and mouse randomness is
                      dubious procedure for a gateway machine. You could
                      also increase the randomness pool size from the
                      default 512 bytes (128 32-bit words).

        Filesystems
                [anything] should work, but we suggest limiting a gateway
                machine to the standard Linux ext2 filesystem in most
                cases.

        Network filesystems
                [disable] These systems are an unnecessary risk on an
                IPsec gateway.

        Console drivers
                [anything]

        Sound
                [anything] should work, but we suggest enabling sound
                only if you plan to use audible alarms for firewall
                problems.

        Kernel hacking
                [disable] This might be enabled on test machines, but
                should not be on production gateways.

                       Other configuration possibilities

   This document describes various options for FreeS/WAN configuration
   which are less used or more complex (often both) than the standard
   cases described in our[1798] config and[1799] quickstart documents.

Some rules of thumb about configuration

  Tunnels are cheap

   Nearly all of the overhead in IPsec processing is in the encryption
   and authentication of packets. Our[1800] performance document
   discusses these overheads.

   Beside those overheads, the cost of managing additional tunnels is
   trivial. Whether your gateway supports one tunnel or ten just does not
   matter. A hundred might be a problem; there is a[1801] section on this
   in the performance document.

   So, in nearly all cases, if using multiple tunnels gives you a
   reasonable way to describe what you need to do, you should describe it
   that way in your configuration files.

   For example, one user recently asked on a mailing list about this
   network configuration:
        netA---gwA---gwB---netB
                            |----netC

   netA and B are secured netC not.
   netA and gwA can not access netC

   The user had constructed only one tunnel, netA to netB, and wanted to
   know how to use ip-route to get netC packets into it. This is entirely
   unnecessary. One of the replies was:
  The simplest way and indeed the right way to
  solve this problem is to set up two connections:

        leftsubnet=NetA
        left=gwA
        right=gwB
        rightsubnet=NetB
  and
        leftsubnet=NetA
        left=gwA
        right=gwB
        rightsubnet=NetC

   This would still be correct even if we added nets D, E, F, ... to the
   above diagram and needed twenty tunnels.

   Of course another possibility would be to just use one tunnel, with a
   subnet mask that includes both netB and netC (or B, C, D, ...). See
   next section.

   In general, you can construct as many tunnels as you need. Networks
   like netC in this example that do not connect directly to the gateway
   are fine, as long as the gateway can route to them.

   The number of tunnels can become an issue if it reaches 50 or so. This
   is discussed in the[1802] performance document. Look there for
   information on supporting hundreds of Road Warriors from one gateway.

   If you find yourself with too many tunnels for some reason like having
   eight subnets at one location and nine at another so you end up with
   9*8=72 tunnels, read the next section here.

  Subnet sizes

   The subnets used in leftsubnet and rightsubnet can be of any size that
   fits your needs, and they need not correspond to physical networks.

   You adjust the size by changing the[1803] subnet mask , the number
   after the slash in the subnet description. For example
     * in 192.168.100.0/24 the /24 mask says 24 bits are used to
       designate the network. This leave 8 bits to label machines. This
       subnet has 256 addresses. .0 and .255 are reserved, so it can have
       254 machines.
     * A subnet with a /23 mask would be twice as large, 512 addresses.
     * A subnet with a /25 mask would be half the size, 128 addresses.
     * /0 is the whole Internet
     * /32 is a single machine

   As an example of using these in connection descriptions, suppose your
   company's head office has four physical networks using the address
   ranges:

   192.168.100.0/24
          development

   192.168.101.0/24
          production

   192.168.102.0/24
          marketing

   192.168.103.0/24
          administration

   You can use exactly those subnets in your connection descriptions, or
   use larger subnets to grant broad access if required:

   leftsubnet=192.168.100.0/24
          remote hosts can access only development

   leftsubnet=192.168.100.0/23
          remote hosts can access development or production

   leftsubnet=192.168.102.0/23
          remote hosts can access marketing or administration

   leftsubnet=192.168.100.0/22
          remote hosts can access any of the four departments

   or use smaller subnets to restrict access:

   leftsubnet=192.168.103.0/24
          remote hosts can access any machine in administration

   leftsubnet=192.168.103.64/28
          remote hosts can access only certain machines in
          administration.

   leftsubnet=192.168.103.42/32
          remote hosts can access only one particular machine in
          administration

   To be exact, 192.68.103.64/28 means all addresses whose top 28 bits
   match 192.168.103.64. There are 16 of these because there are 16
   possibilities for the remainingg 4 bits. Their addresses are
   192.168.103.64 to 192.168.103.79.

   Each connection description can use a different subnet if required.

   It is possible to use all the examples above on the same FreeS/WAN
   gateway, each in a different connection description, perhaps for
   different classes of user or for different remote offices.

   It is also possible to have multiple tunnels using different
   leftsubnet descriptions with the same right. For example, when the
   marketing manager is on the road he or she might have access to:

   leftsubnet=192.168.102.0/24
          all machines in marketing

   192.168.101.32/29
          some machines in production

   leftsubnet=192.168.103.42/32
          one particular machine in administration

   This takes three tunnels, but tunnels are cheap. If the laptop is set
   up to build all three tunnels automatically, then he or she can access
   all these machines concurrently, perhaps from different windows.

  Other network layouts

   Here is the usual network picture for a site-to-site VPN::
     Sunset==========West------------------East=========Sunrise
           local net       untrusted net       local net

   and for the Road Warrior::
                                           telecommuter's PC or
                                           traveller's laptop
     Sunset==========West------------------East
         corporate LAN     untrusted net

   Other configurations are also possible.

    The Internet as a big subnet

   A telecommuter might have:
     Sunset==========West------------------East ================= firewall ---
the Internet
         home network      untrusted net        corporate network

   This can be described as a special case of the general
   subnet-to-subnet connection. The subnet on the right is 0.0.0.0/0, the
   whole Internet.

   West (the home gateway) can have its firewall rules set up so that
   only IPsec packets to East are allowed out. It will then behave as if
   its only connection to the world was a wire to East.

   When machines on the home network need to reach the Internet, they do
   so via the tunnel, East and the corporate firewall. From the viewpoint
   of the Internet (perhaps of some EvilDoer trying to break in!), those
   home office machines are behind the firewall and protected by it.

    Wireless

   Another possible configuration comes up when you do not trust the
   local network, either because you have very high security standards or
   because your are using easily-intercepted wireless signals.

   Some wireless networks have built-in encryption called[1804] WEP, but
   its security is dubious. It is a fairly common practice to use IPsec
   instead.

   In this case, part of your network may look like this:
          West-----------------------------East == the rest of your network
     workstation   untrusted wireless net

   Of course, there would likely be several wireless workstations, each
   with its own IPsec tunnel to the East gateway.

   The connection descriptions look much like Road Warrior descriptions:
     * each workstation should have its own unique
          + identifier for IPsec
          + RSA key
          + connection description.
     * on the gateway, use left=%any, or the workstation IP address
     * on workstations, left=%defaultroute, or the workstation IP address
     * leftsubnet= is not used.

   The rightsubnet= parameter might be set in any of several ways:

   rightsubnet=0.0.0.0/0
          allowing workstations to access the entire Internet (see[1805]
          above)

   rightsubnet=a.b.c.0/24
          allowing access to your entire local network

   rightsubnet=a.b.c.d/32
          restricting the workstation to connecting to a particular
          server

   Of course you can mix and match these as required. For example, a
   university might allow faculty full Internet access while letting
   student laptops connect only to a group of lab machines.

Choosing connection types

   One choice you need to make before configuring additional connections
   is what type or types of connections you will use. There are several
   options, and you can use more than one concurrently.

  Manual vs. automatic keying

   IPsec allows two types of connections, with manual or automatic
   keying. FreeS/WAN starts them with commands such as:
        ipsec manual --up name
        ipsec auto --up name

   The difference is in how they are keyed.

   [1806]Manually keyed connections
          use keys stored in[1807] ipsec.conf .

   [1808]Automatically keyed connections
          use keys automatically generated by the Pluto key negotiation
          daemon. The key negotiation protocol,[1809] IKE, must
          authenticate the other system. (It is vulnerable to a[1810]
          man-in-the-middle attack if used without authentication.) We
          currently support two authentication methods:

          + using shared secrets stored in[1811] ipsec.secrets.
          + RSA[1812] public key authentication, with our machine's
            private key in[1813] ipsec.secrets. Public keys for other
            machines may either be placed in[1814] ipsec.conf or provided
            via DNS.

          A third method, using RSA keys embedded in[1815] X.509
          certtificates, is provided by user[1816] patches.

   [1817]Manually keyed connections provide weaker security than[1818]
   automatically keyed connections. An opponent who reads
   ipsec.secrets(5) gets your encryption key and can read all data
   encrypted by it. If he or she has an archive of old messages, all of
   them back to your last key change are also readable.

   With automatically-(re)-keyed connections, an opponent who reads
   ipsec.secrets(5) gets the key used to authenticate your system in IKE
   -- the shared secret or your private key, depending what
   authentication mechanism is in use. However, he or she does not
   automatically gain access to any encryption keys or any data.

   An attacker who has your authentication key can mount a[1819]
   man-in-the-middle attack and, if that succeeds, he or she will get
   encryption keys and data. This is a serious danger, but it is better
   than having the attacker read everyting as soon as he or she breaks
   into ipsec.secrets(5).. Moreover, the keys change often so an opponent
   who gets one key does not get a large amount of data. To read all your
   data, he or she would have to do a man-in-the-middle attack at every
   key change.

   We discuss using[1820] manual keying in production below, but this is
   not recommended except in special circumstances, such as needing to
   communicate with some implementation that offers no auto-keyed mode
   compatible with FreeS/WAN.

   Manual keying may also be useful for testing. There is some discussion
   of this in our[1821] FAQ.

  Authentication methods for auto-keying

   The IKE protocol which Pluto uses to negotiate connections between
   gateways must use some form of authentication of peers. A gateway must
   know who it is talking to before it can create a secure connection. We
   support two basic methods for this authentication:
     * shared secrets, stored in[1822] ipsec.secrets(5)
     * RSA authentication

   There are, howver, several variations on the RSA theme, using
   different methods of managing the RSA keys:
     * our RSA private key in[1823] ipsec.secrets(5) with other gateways'
       public keys

        either
                stored in[1824] ipsec.conf(5)

        or
                looked up via[1825] DNS

     * authentication with[1826] x.509 certificates.; See our[1827] links
       section for information on user-contributed patches for this.:

   Public keys in[1828] ipsec.conf(5 ) give a reasonably straightforward
   method of specifying keys for explicitly configured connections.

   Putting public keys in DNS allows us to support[1829] opportunistic
   encryption. Any two FreeS/WAN gateways can provide secure
   communication, without either of them having any preset information
   about the other.

   X.509 certificates may be required to interface to various[1830] PKIs.

  Advantages of public key methods

   Authentication with a[1831] public key method such as[1832] RSA has
   some important advantages over using shared secrets.
     * no problem of secure transmission of secrets
          + A shared secret must be shared, so you have the problem of
            transmitting it securely to the other party. If you get this
            wrong, you have no security.
          + With a public key technique, you transmit only your public
            key. The system is designed to ensure that it does not matter
            if an enemy obtains public keys. The private key never leaves
            your machine.
     * easier management
          + Suppose you have 20 branch offices all connecting to one
            gateway at head office, and all using shared secrets. Then
            the head office admin has 20 secrets to manage. Each of them
            must be kept secret not only from outsiders, but also from 19
            of the branch office admins. The branch office admins have
            only one secret each to manage.
            If the branch offices need to talk to each other, this
            becomes problematic. You need another 20*19/2 = 190 secrets
            for branch-to-branch communication, each known to exactly two
            branches. Now all the branch admins have the headache of
            handling 20 keys, each shared with exactly one other branch
            or with head office.
            For larger numbers of branches, the number of connections and
            secrets increases quadratically and managing them becomes a
            nightmare. A 1000-gateway fully connected network needs
            499,500 secrets, each known to exactly two players. There are
            ways to reduce this problem, for example by introducing a
            central key server, but these involve additional
            communication overheads, more administrative work, and new
            threats that must be carefully guarded against.
          + With public key techniques, the only thing you have to keep
            secret is your private key, and you keep that secret from
            everyone .
            As network size increaes, the number of public keys used
            increases linearly with the number of nodes. This still
            requires careful administration in large applications, but is
            nothing like the disaster of a quadratic increase. On a
            1000-gateway network, you have 1000 private keys, each of
            which must be kept secure on one machine, and 1000 public
            keys which must be distributed. This is not a trivial
            problem, but it is manageable.
     * does not require fixed IP addresses
          + When shared secrets are used in IPsec, the responder must be
            able to tell which secret to use by looking at the IP address
            on the incoming packets. When the other parties do not have a
            fixed IP address to be identified by (for example, on nearly
            all dialup ISP connections and many cable or ADSL links),
            this does not work well -- all must share the same secret!
          + When RSA authentication is in use, the initiator can identify
            itself by name before the key must be determined. The
            responder then checks that the message is signed with the
            public key corresponding to that name.

   There is also a disadvantage:
     * your private key is a single point of attack, extremely valuable
       to an enemy
          + with shared secrets, an attacker who steals your
            ipsec.secrets file can impersonate you or try[1833]
            man-in-the-middle attacks, but can only attack connections
            described in that file
          + an attacker who steals your private key gains the chance to
            attack not only existing connections but also any future
            connections created using that key

   This is partly counterbalanced by the fact that the key is never
   transmitted and remains under your control at all times. It is likely
   necessary, however, to take account of this in setting security
   policy. For example, you should change gateway keys when an
   administrator leaves the company, and should change them periodically
   in any case.

   Overall, public key methods are more secure, more easily managed and
   more flexible. We recommend that they be used for all connections,
   unless there is a compelling reason to do otherwise.

Using shared secrets in production

   Generally, public key methods are preferred for reasons given above,
   but shared secrets can be used with no loss of security, just more
   work and perhaps more need to take precautions.

   What I call "shared secrets" are sometimes also called "pre-shared
   keys". They are used only for for authentication, never for
   encryption. Calling them "pre-shared keys" has confused some users
   into thinking they were encryption keys, so I prefer to avoid the
   term..

   If you are interoperating with another IPsec implementation, you may
   find its documentation calling them "passphrases".

  Putting secrets in ipsec.secrets(5)

   If shared secrets are to be used to[1834] authenticate communication
   for the[1835] Diffie-Hellman key exchange in the[1836] IKE protocol,
   then those secrets must be stored in /etc/ipsec.secrets. For details,
   see the[1837] ipsec.secrets(5) man page.

   A few considerations are vital:
     * make the secrets long and unguessable. Since they need not be
       remembered by humans, very long ugly strings may be used. We
       suggest using our[1838] ipsec_ranbits(8) utility to generate long
       (128 bits or more) random strings.
     * transmit secrets securely. You have to share them with other
       systems, but you lose if they are intercepted and used against
       you. Use[1839] PGP,[1840] SSH, hand delivery of a floppy disk
       which is then destroyed, or some other trustworthy method to
       deliver them.
     * store secrets securely, in root-owned files with permissions
       rw------.
     * limit sharing of secrets. Alice, Bob, Carol and Dave may all talk
       to each other, but only Alice and Bob should know the secret for
       an Alice-Bob link.
     * do not share private keys. The private key for RSA authentication
       of your system is stored in[1841] ipsec.secrets(5), but it is a
       different class of secret from the pre-shared keys used for the
       "shared secret" authentication. No-one but you should have the RSA
       private key.

   Each line has the IP addresses of the two gateways plus the secret. It
   should look something like this:
        10.0.0.1 11.0.0.1 : PSK "jxTR1lnmSjuj33n4W51uW3kTR55luUmSmnlRUuWnkjRj3U
uTV4T3USSu23Uk55nWu5TkTUnjT"

   PSK indicates the use of a pre-s hared key. The quotes and the
   whitespace shown are required.

   You can use any character string as your secret. For security, it
   should be both long and extremely hard to guess. We provide a utility
   to generate such strings,[1842] ipsec_ranbits(8).

   You want the same secret on the two gateways used, so you create a
   line with that secret and the two gateway IP addresses. The
   installation process supplies an example secret, useful only for
   testing. You must change it for production use.

  File security

   You must deliver this file, or the relevant part of it, to the other
   gateway machine by some secure means. Don't just FTP or mail the file!
   It is vital that the secrets in it remain secret. An attacker who knew
   those could easily have all the data on your "secure" connection.

   This file must be owned by root and should have permissions rw-------.

  Shared secrets for road warriors

   You can use a shared secret to support a single road warrior
   connecting to your gateway, and this is a reasonable thing to do in
   some circumstances. Public key methods have advantages,
   discussed[1843] above, but they are not critical in this case.

   To do this, the line in ipsec.secrets(5) is something like:
        10.0.0.1 0.0.0.0 : PSK "jxTR1lnmSjuj33n4W51uW3kTR55luUmSmnlRUuWnkjRj3Uu
TV4T3USSu23Uk55nWu5TkTUnjT"

   where the 0.0.0.0 means that any IP address is acceptable.

   For more than one road warrior, shared secrets are not recommended. If
   shared secrets are used, then when the responder needs to look up the
   secret, all it knows about the sender is an IP address. This is fine
   if the sender is at a fixed IP address specified in the config file.
   It is also fine if only one road warrior uses the wildcard 0.0.0.0
   address. However, if you have more than one road warrior using shared
   secret authentication, then they must all use that wildcard and
   therefore all road warriors using PSK autentication must use the same
   secret. Obviously, this is insecure.

   For multiple road warriors, use public key authentication. Each
   roadwarrior can then have its own identity (our leftid= or rightid=
   parameters), its own public/private key pair, and its own secure
   connection.

Using manual keying in production

   Generally,[1844] automatic keying is preferred over[1845] manual
   keying for production use because it is both easier to manage and more
   secure. Automatic keying frees the admin from much of the burden of
   managing keys securely, and can provide[1846] perfect forward secrecy.
   This is discussed in more detail[1847] above.

   However, it is possible to use manual keying in production if that is
   what you want to do. This might be necessary, for example, in order to
   interoperate with some device that either does not provide automatic
   keying or provides it in some version we cannot talk to.

   Note that with manual keying all security rests with the keys . If an
   adversary acquires your keys, you've had it. He or she can read
   everything ever sent with those keys, including old messages he or she
   may have archived.

   You need to be really paranoid about keys if you're going to rely on
   manual keying for anything important.
     * keep keys in files with 600 permissions, owned by root
     * be extremely careful about security of your gateway systems.
       Anyone who breaks into a gateway and gains root privileges can get
       all your keys and read everything ever encrypted with those keys,
       both old messages he has archived and any new ones you may send.
     * change keys regularly. This can be a considerable bother, (and
       provides an excellent reason to consider automatic keying
       instead), but it is absolutely essential for security. Consider a
       manually keyed system in which you leave the same key in place for
       months:
          + an attacker can have a very large sample of text sent with
            that key to work with. This makes various cryptographic
            attacks much more likely to succeed.
          + The chances of the key being compromised in some
            non-cryptographic manner -- a spy finds it on a discarded
            notepad, someone breaks into your server or your building and
            steals it, a staff member is bribed, tricked, seduced or
            coerced into revealing it, etc. -- also increase over time.
          + a successful attacker can read everything ever sent with that
            key. This makes any successful attack extremely damaging.
       It is clear that you must change keys often to have any useful
       security. The only question is how often.
     * use[1848] PGP or[1849] SSH for all key transfers
     * don't edit files with keys in them when someone can look over your
       shoulder
     * worry about network security; could someone get keys by snooping
       packets on the LAN between your X desktop and the gateway?
     * lock up your backup tapes for the gateway system
     * ... and so on

   Linux FreeS/WAN provides some facilities to help with this. In
   particular, it is good policy to keep keys in separate files so you
   can edit configuration information in /etc/ipsec.conf without exposing
   keys to "shoulder surfers" or network snoops. We support this with the
   also= and include syntax in[1850] ipsec.conf(5).

   See the last example in our[1851] examples file. In the
   /etc/ipsec.conf conn samplesep section, it has the line:
        also=samplesep-keys

   which tells the "ipsec manual" script to insert the configuration
   description labelled "samplesep-keys" if it can find it. The
   /etc/ipsec.conf file must also have a line such as:
include ipsec.*.conf

   which tells it to read other files. One of those other files then
   might contain the additional data:
conn samplesep-keys
  spi=0x200
  esp=3des-md5-96
  espenckey=0x01234567_89abcdef_02468ace_13579bdf_12345678_9abcdef0
  espauthkey=0x12345678_9abcdef0_2468ace0_13579bdf

   The first line matches the label in the "also=" line, so the indented
   lines are inserted. The net effect is exactly as if the inserted lines
   had occurred in the original file in place of the "also=" line.

   Variables set here are:

   spi
          A number needed by the manual keying code. Any 3-digit hex
          number will do, but if you have more than one manual connection
          then spi must be different for each connection.

   esp
          Options for[1852] ESP (Encapsulated Security Payload), the
          usual IPsec encryption mode. Settings here are for[1853]
          encryption using[1854] triple DES and[1855] authentication
          using[1856] MD5. Note that encryption without authentication
          should not be used; it is insecure.

   espenkey
          Key for ESP encryption. Here, a 192-bit hex number for triple
          DES.

   espauthkey
          Key for ESP authentication. Here, a 128-bit hex number for MD5.

   Note that the example keys we supply are intended only for testing.
   For real use, you should go to automatic keying. If that is not
   possible, create your own keys for manual mode and keep them secret

   Of course, any files containing keys must have 600 permissions and be
   owned by root.

   If you connect in this way to multiple sites, we recommend that you
   keep keys for each site in a separate file and adopt some naming
   convention that lets you pick them all up with a single "include"
   line. This minimizes the risk of losing several keys to one error or
   attack and of accidentally giving another site admin keys which he or
   she has no business knowing.

   Also note that if you have multiple manually keyed connections on a
   single machine, then the spi parameter must be different for each one.
   Any 3-digit hex number is OK, provided they are different for each
   connection. We reserve the range 0x100 to 0xfff for manual
   connections. Pluto assigns SPIs from 0x1000 up for automatically keyed
   connections.

   If[1857] ipsec.conf(5) contains keys for manual mode connections, then
   it too must have permissions rw-------. We recommend instead that, if
   you must manual keying in production, you keep the keys in separate
   files.

   Note also that[1858] ipsec.conf is installed with permissions
   rw-r--r--. If you plan to use manually keyed connections for anything
   more than initial testing, you must:
     * either change permissions to rw-------
     * or store keys separately in secure files and access them via
       include statements in[1859] ipsec.conf.

   We recommend the latter method for all but the simplest
   configurations.

  Creating keys with ranbits

   You can create new[1860] random keys with the[1861] ranbits(8)
   utility. For example, the commands:
      umask 177
      ipsec ranbits 192  > temp
      ipsec ranbits 128 >> temp

   create keys in the sizes needed for our default algorithms:
     * 192-bit key for[1862] 3DES encryption
       (only 168 bits are used; parity bits are ignored)
     * 128-bit key for keyed[1863] MD5 authentication

   If you want to use[1864] SHA instead of[1865] MD5, that requires a
   160-bit key

   Note that any temporary files used must be kept secure since they
   contain keys. That is the reason for the umask command above. The
   temporary file should be deleted as soon as you are done with it. You
   may also want to change the umask back to its default value after you
   are finished working on keys.

   The ranbits utility may pause for a few seconds if not enough entropy
   is available immediately. See ipsec_ranbits(8) and random(4) for
   details. You may wish to provide some activity to feed entropy into
   the system. For example, you might move the mouse around, type random
   characters, or do du /usr > /dev/null in the background.

Setting up connections at boot time

   You can tell the system to set up connections automatically at boot
   time by putting suitable stuff in /etc/ipsec.conf on both systems. The
   relevant section of the file is labelled by a line reading config
   setup.

   Details can be found in the[1866] ipsec.conf(5) man page. We also
   provide a file of[1867] example configurations.

   The most likely options are something like:

   interfaces="ipsec0=eth0 ipsec1=ppp0"
          Tells KLIPS which interfaces to use. Up to four interfaces
          numbered ipsec[0-3] are supported. Each interface can support
          an arbitrary number of tunnels.

          Note that for PPP, you give the ppp[0-9] device name here, not
          the underlying device such as modem (or eth1 if you are using
          PPPoE).

   interfaces=%defaultroute
          Alternative setting, useful in simple cases. KLIPS will pick up
          both its interface and the next hop information from the
          settings of the Linux default route.

   forwardcontrol=no
          Normally "no". Set to "yes" if the IP forwarding option is
          disabled in your network configuration. (This can be set as a
          kernel configuration option or later. e.g. on Redhat, it's in
          /etc/sysconfig/network and on SuSE you can adjust it with
          Yast.) Linux FreeS/WAN will then enable forwarding when
          starting up and turn it off when going down. This is used to
          ensure that no packets will be forwarded before IPsec comes up
          and takes control.

   syslog=daemon.error
          Used in messages to the system logging daemon (syslogd) to
          specify what type of software is sending the messages. If the
          settings are "daemon.error" as in our example, then syslogd
          treats the messages as error messages from a daemon.

          Note that[1868] Pluto does not currently pay attention to this
          variable. The variable controls setup messages only.

   klipsdebug=
          Debug settings for[1869] KLIPS.

   plutodebug=
          Debug settings for[1870] Pluto.

   ... for both the above DEBUG settings
          Normally, leave empty as shown above for no debugging output.
          Use "all" for maximum information.
          See ipsec_klipsdebug(8) and ipsec_pluto(8) man page for other
          options. Beware that if you set /etc/ipsec.conf to enable debug
          output, your system's log files may get large quickly.

   dumpdir=/safe/directory
          Normally, programs started by ipsec setup don't crash. If they
          do, by default, no core dump will be produced because such
          dumps would contain secrets. If you find you need to debug such
          crashes, you can set dumpdir to the name of a directory in
          which to collect the core file.

   manualstart=
          List of manually keyed connections to be automatically started
          at boot time. Useful for testing, but not for long term use.
          Connections which are automatically started should also be
          automatically re-keyed.

   pluto=yes
          Whether to start[1871] Pluto when ipsec startup is done.
          This parameter is optional and defaults to "yes" if not
          present.

          "yes" is strongly recommended for production use so that the
          keying daemon (Pluto) will automatically re-key the connections
          regularly. The ipsec-auto parameters ikelifetime, ipseclifetime
          and reykeywindow give you control over frequency of rekeying.

   plutoload="reno-van reno-adam reno-nyc"
          List of tunnels (by name, e.g. fred-susan or reno-van in our
          examples) to be loaded into Pluto's internal database at
          startup. In this example, Pluto loads three tunnels into its
          database when it is started.

          If plutoload is "%search", Pluto will load any connections
          whose description includes "auto=add" or "auto=start".

   plutostart="reno-van reno-adam reno-nyc"
          List of tunnels to attempt to negotiate when Pluto is started.

          If plutostart is "%search", Pluto will start any connections
          whose description includes "auto=start".

          Note that, for a connection intended to be permanent, both
          gateways should be set try to start the tunnel. This allows
          quick recovery if either gateway is rebooted or has its IPsec
          restarted. If only one gateway is set to start the tunnel and
          the other gateway restarts, the tunnel may not be rebuilt.

   plutowait=no
          Controls whether Pluto waits for one tunnel to be established
          before starting to negotiate the next. You might set this to
          "yes"

          + if your gateway is a very limited machine and you need to
            conserve resources.
          + for debugging; the logs are clearer if only one connection is
            brought up at a time

          For a busy and resource-laden production gateway, you likely
          want "no" so that connections are brought up in parallel and
          the whole process takes less time.

   The example assumes you are at the Reno office and will use IPsec to
   Vancouver, New York City and Amsterdam.

Multiple tunnels between the same two gateways

   Consider a pair of subnets, each with a security gateway, connected
   via the Internet:
         192.168.100.0/24           left subnet
              |
         192.168.100.1
         North Gateway
         101.101.101.101            left
              |
         101.101.101.1              left next hop
         [Internet]
         202.202.202.1              right next hop
              |
         202.202.202.202            right
         South gateway
         192.168.200.1
              |
         192.168.200.0/24           right subnet

   A tunnel specification such as:
conn northnet-southnet
      left=101.101.101.101
      leftnexthop=101.101.101.1
      leftsubnet=192.168.100.0/24
      leftfirewall=yes
      right=202.202.202.202
      rightnexthop=202.202.202.1
      rightsubnet=192.168.200.0/24
      rightfirewall=yes

   will allow machines on the two subnets to talk to each other. You
   might test this by pinging from polarbear (192.168.100.7) to penguin
   (192.168.200.5).

   However, this does not cover other traffic you might want to secure.
   To handle all the possibilities, you might also want these connection
   descriptions:
conn northgate-southnet
      left=101.101.101.101
      leftnexthop=101.101.101.1
      right=202.202.202.202
      rightnexthop=202.202.202.1
      rightsubnet=192.168.200.0/24
      rightfirewall=yes

conn northnet-southgate
      left=101.101.101.101
      leftnexthop=101.101.101.1
      leftsubnet=192.168.100.0/24
      leftfirewall=yes
      right=202.202.202.202
      rightnexthop=202.202.202.1

   Without these, neither gateway can do IPsec to the remote subnet.
   There is no IPsec tunnel or eroute set up for the traffic.

   In our example, with the non-routable 192.168.* addresses used,
   packets would simply be discarded. In a different configuration, with
   routable addresses for the remote subnet, they would be sent
   unencrypted since there would be no IPsec eroute and there would be a
   normal IP route.

   You might also want:
conn northgate-southgate
      left=101.101.101.101
      leftnexthop=101.101.101.1
      right=202.202.202.202
      rightnexthop=202.202.202.1

   This is required if you want the two gateways to speak IPsec to each
   other.

   This requires a lot of duplication of details. Judicious use of also=
   and include can reduce this problem.

   Note that, while FreeS/WAN supports all four tunnel types, not all
   implementations do. In particular, some versions of Windows 2000 and
   the freely downloadable version of PGP provide only "client"
   functionality. You cannot use them as gateways with a subnet behind
   them. To get that functionality, you must upgrade to Windows 2000
   server or the commercially available PGP products.

  One tunnel plus advanced routing

   It is also possible to use the new routing features in 2.2 and later
   kernels to avoid most needs for multple tunnels. Here is one mailing
   list message on the topic:

I keep wondering why people create all four tunnels.  Why not route
traffic generated from home to 10.91.10.24/24 out ipsec0 with iproute2?
And 99% of the time you don't need to access "office" directly, which
means you can eliminate all but the subnet<->subnet connection.

This is feasible, given some iproute2 attention to source addresses, but
it isn't something we've documented yet... (partly because we're still
making some attempt to support 2.0.xx kernels, which can't do this, but
mostly because we haven't caught up with it yet).

Correct in principle, but people will keep trying to ping to or from the
gateways during testing, and sometimes they want to run services on the
gateway machines too.

An Opportunistic Gateway

  Start from full opportunism

   Full opportunism allows you to initiate and receive opportunistic
   connections on your machine. The remaining instructions in this
   section assume you have first set up full opportunism on your gateway
   using[1872] these instructions. Both sets of instructions require
   mailing DNS records to your ISP. Collect DNS records for both the
   gateway (above) and the subnet nodes (below) before contacting your
   ISP.

  Reverse DNS TXT records for each protected machine

   You need these so that your Opportunistic peers can:
     * discover the gateway's address, knowing only the IP address that
       packets are bound for
     * verify that the gateway is authorised to encrypt for that endpoint

   On the gateway, generate a TXT record with:
    ipsec showhostkey --txt 192.0.2.11

   Use your gateway address in place of 192.0.2.11.

   You should see (keys are trimmed for clarity throughout our example):
    ; RSA 2048 bits  gateway.example.com   Sat Apr 15 13:53:22 2000
    IN TXT  "X-IPsec-Server(10)=192.0.2.11" " AQOF8tZ2...+buFuFn/"

   This MUST BE the same key as in your gateway's TXT record, or nothing
   will work.

   In a text file, make one copy of this TXT record for each subnet node:
    ; RSA 2048 bits  gateway.example.com   Sat Apr 15 13:53:22 2000
    IN TXT  "X-IPsec-Server(10)=192.0.2.11" " AQOF8tZ2...+buFuFn/"


    ; RSA 2048 bits  gateway.example.com   Sat Apr 15 13:53:22 2000
    IN TXT  "X-IPsec-Server(10)=192.0.2.11" " AQOF8tZ2...+buFuFn/"


    ; RSA 2048 bits  gateway.example.com   Sat Apr 15 13:53:22 2000
    IN TXT  "X-IPsec-Server(10)=192.0.2.11" " AQOF8tZ2...+buFuFn/"

   Above each entry, insert a line like this:
    98.2.0.192.in-addr.arpa. IN PTR arthur.example.com.

   It must include:
     * The subnet node's address in reverse map format. For example,
       192.0.2.120 becomes 120.2.0.192.in-addr.arpa.. Note the final
       period.
     * IN PTR
     * The node's name, ie. arthur.example.com.. Note the final period.

   The result will be a file of TXT records, like this:
    98.2.0.192.in-addr.arpa. IN PTR arthur.example.com.
    ; RSA 2048 bits  gateway.example.com   Sat Apr 15 13:53:22 2000
    IN TXT  "X-IPsec-Server(10)=192.0.2.11" " AQOF8tZ2...+buFuFn/"


    99.2.0.192.in-addr.arpa. IN PTR ford.example.com.
    ; RSA 2048 bits  gateway.example.com   Sat Apr 15 13:53:22 2000
    IN TXT  "X-IPsec-Server(10)=192.0.2.11" " AQOF8tZ2...+buFuFn/"


    100.2.0.192.in-addr.arpa. IN PTR trillian.example.com.
    ; RSA 2048 bits  gateway.example.com   Sat Apr 15 13:53:22 2000
    IN TXT  "X-IPsec-Server(10)=192.0.2.11" " AQOF8tZ2...+buFuFn/"

  Publish your records

   Ask your ISP to publish all the reverse DNS records you have
   collected. There may be a delay of up to 48 hours as the records
   propagate.

  ...and test them

   Check a couple of records with commands like this one:
    ipsec verify --host ford.example.com
    ipsec verify --host trillian.example.com

   The verify command checks for TXT records for both the subnet host and
   its gateway. You should see output like:
    ...
    Looking for TXT in reverse map: 99.2.0.192.in-addr.arpa [OK]
    ...
    Looking for TXT in reverse map: 11.2.0.192.in-addr.arpa   [OK]

  No Configuration Needed

   FreeS/WAN 2.x ships with a built-in, automatically enabled OE
   connection conn packetdefault which applies OE, if possible, to all
   outbound traffic routed through the FreeS/WAN box. The[1873]
   ipsec.conf(5) manual describes this connection in detail. While the
   effect is much the same as private-or-clear, the implementation is
   different: notably, it does not use policy groups.

   You can create more complex OE configurations for traffic forwarded
   through a FreeS/WAN box, as explained in our[1874] policy groups
   document, or disable OE using[1875] these instructions.

Extruded Subnets

   What we call[1876] extruded subnets are a special case of[1877] VPNs.

   If your buddy has some unused IP addresses, in his subnet far off at
   the other side of the Internet, he can loan them to you... provided
   that the connection between you and him is fast enough to carry all
   the traffic between your machines and the rest of the Internet. In
   effect, he "extrudes" a part of his address space over the network to
   you, with your Internet traffic appearing to originate from behind his
   Internet gateway.

   As far as the Internet is concerned, your new extruded net is behind
   your buddy's gateway. You route all your packets for the Internet at
   large out his gateway, and receive return packets the same way. You
   route your local packets locally.

   Suppose your friend has a.b.c.0/24 and wants to give you a.b.c.240/28.
   The initial situation is:
    subnet           gateway          Internet
  a.b.c.0/24    a.b.c.1    p.q.r.s

   where anything from the Internet destined for any machine in
   a.b.c.0/24 is routed via p.q.r.s and that gateway knows what to do
   from there.

   Of course it is quite normal for various smaller subnets to exist
   behind your friend's gateway. For example, your friend's company might
   have a.b.c.16/28=development, a.b.c.32/28=marketing and so on. The
   Internet neither knows not cares about this; it just delivers packets
   to the p.q.r.s and lets the gateway do whatever needs to be done from
   there.

   What we want to do is take a subnet, perhaps a.b.c.240/28, out of your
   friend's physical location while still having your friend's gateway
   route to it. As far as the Internet is concerned, you remain behind
   that gateway.
    subnet           gateway          Internet       your gate  extruded

  a.b.c.0/24   a.b.c.1     p.q.r.s              d.e.f.g         a.b.c.240/28


                           ========== tunnel ==========

   The extruded addresses have to be a complete subnet.

   In our example, the friend's security gateway is also his Internet
   gateway, but this is not necessary. As long as all traffic from the
   Internet to his addresses passes through the Internet gate, the
   security gate could be a machine behind that. The IG would need to
   route all traffic for the extruded subnet to the SG, and the SG could
   handle the rest.

   First, configure your subnet using the extruded addresses. Your
   security gateway's interface to your subnet needs to have an extruded
   address (possibly using a Linux[1878] virtual interface , if it also
   has to have a different address). Your gateway needs to have a route
   to the extruded subnet, pointing to that interface. The other machines
   at your site need to have addresses in that subnet, and default routes
   pointing to your gateway.

   If any of your friend's machines need to talk to the extruded subnet,
   they need to have a route for the extruded subnet, pointing at his
   gateway.

   Then set up an IPsec subnet-to-subnet tunnel between your gateway and
   his, with your subnet specified as the extruded subnet, and his subnet
   specified as "0.0.0.0/0".

   The tunnel description should be:
conn extruded
        left=p.q.r.s
        leftsubnet=0.0.0.0/0
        right=d.e.f.g
        rightsubnet=a.b.c.0/28

   If either side was doing firewalling for the extruded subnet before
   the IPsec connection is set up, you'll need to poke holes in
   your[1879] firewall to allow packets through.

   And it all just works. Your SG routes traffic for 0.0.0.0/0 -- that
   is, the whole Internet -- through the tunnel to his SG, which then
   sends it onward as if it came from his subnet. When traffic for the
   extruded subnet arrives at his SG, it gets sent through the tunnel to
   your SG, which passes it to the right machine.

   Remember that when ipsec_manual or ipsec_auto takes a connection down,
   it does not undo the route it made for that connection. This lets you
   take a connection down and bring up a new one, or a modified version
   of the old one, without having to rebuild the route it uses and
   without any risk of packets which should use IPsec accidentally going
   out in the clear. Because the route always points into KLIPS, the
   packets will always go there. Because KLIPS temporarily has no idea
   what to do with them (no eroute for them), they will be discarded.

   If you do want to take the route down, this is what the "unroute"
   operation in manual and auto is for. Just do an unroute after doing
   the down.

   Note that the route for a connection may have replaced an existing
   non-IPsec route. Nothing in Linux FreeS/WAN will put that pre-IPsec
   route back. If you need it back, you have to create it with the route
   command.

Road Warrior with virtual IP address

   Please note that[1880] Super FreeS/WAN now features DHCP-over-IPsec,
   which is an alternate procedure for Virtual IP address assignment.

   Here is a mailing list message about another way to configure for road
   warrior support:

If it is possible to configure your mobile client software *not* to
use a virtual IP address, that will make your life easier. It is easier
to configure FreeS/WAN to use the actual address the mobile user gets
from its ISP.

Unfortunately, some Windows clients don't let you choose.

As someone else stated, yes, the Linux box would usually be the default
IP gateway for the local lan.

However...

If you mobile user has software that *must* use a virtual IP address,
the whole picture changes. Nobody has put much effort into getting
FreeS/WAN to play well in this environment, but here's a sketch of one
approach:

Local Lan 1.0.0.0/24
    |
    +- Linux FreeS/WAN 1.0.0.2
    |
    | 1.0.0.1
 Router
    | 2.0.0.1
    |
Internet
    |
    | 3.0.0.1
Mobile User
      Virtual Address: 1.0.0.3

Note that the Local Lan network (1.0.0.x) can be registered, routable
addresses.

Now, the Mobile User sets up an IPSec security association with the
Linux box (1.0.0.2); it should ESP encapsulate all traffic to the
network 1.0.0.x **EXCEPT** UDP port 500. 500/udp is required for the key
negotiation, which needs to work outside of the IPSec tunnel.

On the Linux side, there's a bunch of stuff you need to do by hand (for
now). FreeS/WAN should correctly handle setting up the IPSec SA and
routes, but I haven't tested it so this may not work...

The FreeS/WAN conn should look like:

conn mobile
        right=1.0.0.2
        rightsubnet=1.0.0.0/24
        rightnexthop=1.0.0.1
        left=0.0.0.0  # The infamous "road warrior"
        leftsubnet=1.0.0.3/32

Note that the left subnet contains *only* the remote host's virtual
address.

Hopefully the routing table on the FreeS/WAN box ends up looking like
this:

% netstat -rn
Kernel IP routing table
Destination     Gateway      Genmask         Flags   MSS Window  irtt Iface
1.0.0.0         0.0.0.0      255.255.255.0   U      1500 0          0 eth0
127.0.0.0       0.0.0.0      255.0.0.0       U      3584 0          0 lo
0.0.0.0         1.0.0.1      0.0.0.0         UG     1500 0          0 eth0
1.0.0.3         1.0.0.1      255.255.255.255 UG     1433 0          0 ipsec0

So, if anybody sends a packet for 1.0.0.3 to the Linux box, it should
get bundled up and sent through the tunnel. To get the packets for
1.0.0.3 to the Linux box in the first place, you need to use "proxy
ARP".

How this works is: when a host or router on the local Ethernet segment
wants to send a packet to 1.0.0.3, it sends out an Ethernet level
broadcast "ARP request". If 1.0.0.3 was on the local LAN, it would
reply, saying "send IP packets for 1.0.0.3 to my Ethernet address".

Instead, you need to set up the Linux box so that _it_ answers ARP
requests for 1.0.0.3, even though that isn't its IP address. That
convinces everyone else on the lan to send 1.0.0.3 packets to the Linux
box, where the usual FreeS/WAN processing and routing take over.

% arp -i eth0 -s 1.0.0.3 -D eth0 pub

This says, if you see an ARP request on interface eth0 asking for
1.0.0.3, respond with the Ethernet address of interface eth0.

Now, as I said at the very beginning, if it is *at all* possible to
configure your client *not* to use the virtual IP address, you can avoid
this whole mess.

Dynamic Network Interfaces

   Sometimes you have to cope with a situation where the network
   interface(s) aren't all there at boot. The common example is notebooks
   with PCMCIA.

  Basics

   The key issue here is that the config setup section of the
   /etc/ipsec.conf configuration file lists the connection between ipsecN
   and hardware interfaces, in the interfaces= variable. At any time when
   ipsec setup start or ipsec setup restart is run this variable must
   correspond to the current real situation. More precisely, it must not
   mention any hardware interfaces which don't currently exist. The
   difficulty is that an ipsec setup start command is normally run at
   boot time so interfaces that are not up then are mis-handled.

  Boot Time

   Normally, an ipsec setup start is run at boot time. However, if the
   hardware situation at boot time is uncertain, one of two things must
   be done.
     * One possibility is simply not to have IPsec brought up at boot
       time. To do this:
        chkconfig --level 2345 ipsec off
       That's for modern Red Hats or other Linuxes with chkconfig.
       Systems which lack this will require fiddling with symlinks in
       /etc/rc.d/rc?.d or the equivalent.
     * Another possibility is to bring IPsec up with no interfaces, which
       is less aesthetically satisfying but simpler. Just put
        interfaces=
       in the configuration file. KLIPS and Pluto will be started, but
       won't do anything.

  Change Time

   When the hardware *is* in place, IPsec has to be made aware of it.
   Someday there may be a nice way to do this.

   Right now, the way to do it is to fix the /etc/ipsec.conf file
   appropriately, so interfaces reflects the new situation, and then
   restart the IPsec subsystem. This does break any existing IPsec
   connections.

   If IPsec wasn't brought up at boot time, do
        ipsec setup start

   while if it was, do
        ipsec setup restart

   which won't be as quick.

   If some of the hardware is to be taken out, before doing that, amend
   the configuration file so interfaces no longer includes it, and do
        ipsec setup restart

   Again, this breaks any existing connections.

Unencrypted tunnels

   Sometimes you might want to create a tunnel without encryption. Often
   this is a bad idea, even if you have some data which need not be
   private. See this[1881] discussion.

   The IPsec protocols provide two ways to do build such tunnels:

   using ESP with null encryption
          not supported by FreeS/WAN

   using[1882] AH without[1883] ESP
          supported for manually keyed connections
          possible with explicit commands via[1884] ipsec_whack(8) (see
          this[1885] list message)
          not supported in the[1886] ipsec_auto(8) scripts.

   One situation in which this comes up is when otherwise some data would
   be encrypted twice. Alice wants a secure tunnel from her machine to
   Bob's. Since she's behind one security gateway and he's behind
   another, part of the tunnel that they build passes through the tunnel
   that their site admins have built between the gateways. All of Alice
   and Bob's messages are encrypted twice.

   There are several ways to handle this.
     * Just accept the overhead of double encryption. The site admins
       might choose this if any of the following apply:
          + policy says encrypt everything (usually, it should)
          + they don't entirely trust Alice and Bob (usually, if they
            don't have to, they shouldn't)
          + if they don't feel the saved cycles are worth the time they'd
            need to build a non-encrypted tunnel for Alice and Bob's
            packets (often, they aren't)
     * Use a plain IP-in-IP tunnel. These are not well documented. A good
       starting point is in the Linux kernel source tree, in
       /usr/src/linux/drivers/net/README.tunnel.
     * Use a manually-keyed AH-only tunnel.

   Note that if Alice and Bob want end-to-end security, they must build a
   tunnel end-to-end between their machines or use some other end-to-end
   tool such as PGP or SSL that suits their data. The only question is
   whether the admins build some special unencrypted tunnel for those
   already-encrypted packets.

                             Installing FreeS/WAN

   This document will teach you how to install Linux FreeS/WAN. If your
   distribution comes with Linux FreeS/WAN, we offer tips to get you
   started.

Requirements

   To install FreeS/WAN you must:
     * be running Linux with the 2.4 or 2.2 kernel series. See this[1887]
       kernel compatibility table.
       We also have experimental support for 2.6 kernels. Here are two
       basic approaches:
          + install FreeS/WAN, including its[1888] KLIPS kernel code.
            This will remove the native IPsec stack and replace it with
            KLIPS.
          + install the FreeS/WAN[1889] userland tools (keying daemon and
            supporting scripts) for use with[1890] 2.6 kernel native
            IPsec,
       See also these[1891] known issues with 2.6.
     * have root access to your Linux box
     * choose the version of FreeS/WAN you wish to install based on[1892]
       mailing list reports

Choose your install method

   There are three basic ways to get FreeS/WAN onto your system:
     * activating and testing a FreeS/WAN that[1893] shipped with your
       Linux distribution
     * [1894]RPM install
     * [1895]Install from source

FreeS/WAN ships with some Linuxes

   FreeS/WAN comes with[1896] these distributions.

   If you're running one of these, include FreeS/WAN in the choices you
   make during installation, or add it later using the distribution's
   tools.

  FreeS/WAN may be altered...

   Your distribution may have integrated extra features, such as Andreas
   Steffen's X.509 patch, into FreeS/WAN. It may also use custom startup
   script locations or directory names.

  You might need to create an authentication keypair

   If your FreeS/WAN came with your distribution, you may wish to
   generate a fresh RSA key pair. FreeS/WAN will use these keys for
   authentication.

   To do this, become root, and type:
    ipsec newhostkey --output /etc/ipsec.secrets --hostname xy.example.com
    chmod 600 /etc/ipsec.secrets

   where you replace xy.example.com with your machine's fully-qualified
   domain name. Generate some randomness, for example by wiggling your
   mouse, to speed the process.

   The resulting ipsec.secrets looks like:
: RSA   {
        # RSA 2192 bits   xy.example.com   Sun Jun 8 13:42:19 2003
        # for signatures only, UNSAFE FOR ENCRYPTION
        #pubkey=0sAQOFppfeE3cC7wqJi...
        Modulus: 0x85a697de137702ef0...
        # everything after this point is secret
        PrivateExponent: 0x16466ea5033e807...
        Prime1: 0xdfb5003c8947b7cc88759065...
        Prime2: 0x98f199b9149fde11ec956c814...
        Exponent1: 0x9523557db0da7a885af90aee...
        Exponent2: 0x65f6667b63153eb69db8f300dbb...
        Coefficient: 0x90ad00415d3ca17bebff123413fc518...
        }
# do not change the indenting of that "}"

   In the actual file, the strings are much longer.

  Start and test FreeS/WAN

   You can now[1897] start FreeS/WAN and test whether it's been
   successfully installed..

RPM install

   These instructions are for a recent Red Hat with a stock Red Hat
   kernel. We know that Mandrake and SUSE also produce FreeS/WAN RPMs. If
   you're running either, install using your distribution's tools.

  Download RPMs

   Decide which functionality you need:
     * standard FreeS/WAN RPMs. Use these shortcuts:
          + (for 2.6 kernels: userland only)
            ncftpget
            ftp://ftp.xs4all.nl/pub/crypto/freeswan/binaries/RedHat-RPMs/
            \*userland*
          + (for 2.4 kernels)
            ncftpget
            ftp://ftp.xs4all.nl/pub/crypto/freeswan/binaries/RedHat-RPMs/
            `uname -r | tr -d 'a-wy-z'`/\*
          + or view all the offerings at our[1898] FTP site.
     * unofficial[1899] Super FreeS/WAN RPMs, which include Andreas
       Steffen's X.509 patch and more. Super FreeS/WAN RPMs do not
       currently include[1900] Network Address Translation (NAT)
       traversal, but Super FreeS/WAN source does.

   For 2.6 kernels, get the latest FreeS/WAN userland RPM, for example:
    freeswan-userland-2.03.9-0.i386.rpm

   Note: FreeS/WAN's support for 2.6 kernel IPsec is preliminary. Please
   see[1901] 2.6.known-issues, and the latest[1902] mailing list reports.

   Change to your new FreeS/WAN directory, and make and install the

   For 2.4 kernels, get both kernel and userland RPMs. Check your kernel
   version with
    uname -r

   Get a kernel module which matches that version. For example:
    freeswan-module-2.03_2.4.20_20.9-0.i386.rpm

   Note: These modules will only work on the Red Hat kernel they were
   built for, since they are very sensitive to small changes in the
   kernel.

   Get FreeS/WAN utilities to match. For example:
    freeswan-userland-2.03_2.4.20_20.9-0.i386.rpm

  For freeswan.org RPMs: check signatures

   While you're at our ftp site, grab the RPM signing key
    freeswan-rpmsign.asc

   If you're running RedHat 8.x or later, import this key into the RPM
   database:
    rpm --import freeswan-rpmsign.asc

   For RedHat 7.x systems, you'll need to add it to your[1903] PGP
   keyring:
    pgp -ka freeswan-rpmsign.asc

   Check the digital signatures on both RPMs using:
    rpm --checksig freeswan*.rpm

   You should see that these signatures are good:
    freeswan-module-2.03_2.4.20_20.9-0.i386.rpm: pgp md5 OK
    freeswan-userland-2.03_2.4.20_20.9-0.i386.rpm: pgp md5 OK

  Install the RPMs

   Become root:
    su

   For a first time install, use:
    rpm -ivh freeswan*.rpm

   To upgrade existing RPMs (and keep all .conf files in place), use:
    rpm -Uvh freeswan*.rpm

   If you're upgrading from FreeS/WAN 1.x to 2.x RPMs, and encounter
   problems, see[1904] this note.

  Start and Test FreeS/WAN

   Now,[1905] start FreeS/WAN and test your install.

Install from Source

  Decide what functionality you need

   Your choices are:
     * [1906]standard FreeS/WAN ,
     * standard FreeS/WAN plus any of these[1907] user-supported patches,
       or
     * [1908]Super FreeS/WAN, an unofficial FreeS/WAN pre-patched with
       many of the above. Provides additional algorithms, X.509, SA
       deletion, dead peer detection, and[1909] Network Address
       Translation (NAT) traversal.

  Download FreeS/WAN

   Download the source tarball you've chosen, along with any patches.

  For freeswan.org source: check its signature

   While you're at our ftp site, get our source signing key
    freeswan-sigkey.asc

   Add it to your PGP keyring:
    pgp -ka freeswan-sigkey.asc

   Check the signature using:
    pgp freeswan-2.03.tar.gz.sig freeswan-2.03.tar.gz

   You should see something like:
    Good signature from user "Linux FreeS/WAN Software Team (build@freeswan.org
)".
    Signature made 2002/06/26 21:04 GMT using 2047-bit key, key ID 46EAFCE1

  Untar, unzip

   As root, unpack your FreeS/WAN source into /usr/src.
    su
    mv freeswan-2.03.tar.gz /usr/src
    cd /usr/src
    tar -xzf freeswan-2.03.tar.gz

  Patch if desired

   Now's the time to add any patches. The contributor may have special
   instructions, or you may simply use the patch command.

  ... and Make

   Choose one of the methods below.

    Userland-only Install for 2.6 kernels

   Note: FreeS/WAN's support for 2.6 kernel IPsec is preliminary. Please
   see[1910] 2.6.known-issues, and the latest[1911] mailing list reports.

   Change to your new FreeS/WAN directory, and make and install the
   FreeS/WAN userland tools.
    cd /usr/src/freeswan-2.03
    make programs
    make install

   Now,[1912] start FreeS/WAN and test your install.

    KLIPS install for 2.2, 2.4, or 2.6 kernels

   To make a modular version of KLIPS, along with other FreeS/WAN
   programs you'll need, use the command sequence below. This will change
   to your new FreeS/WAN directory, make the FreeS/WAN module (and other
   stuff), and install it all.
    cd /usr/src/freeswan-2.03
    make oldmod
    make minstall

   [1913]Start FreeS/WAN and test your install.

   To link KLIPS statically into your kernel (using your old kernel
   settings), and install other FreeS/WAN components, do:
    cd /usr/src/freeswan-2.03
    make oldmod
    make minstall

   Reboot your system and[1914] test your install.

   For other ways to compile KLIPS, see our Makefile.

Start FreeS/WAN and test your install

   Bring FreeS/WAN up with:
    service ipsec start

   This is not necessary if you've rebooted.

Test your install

   To check that you have a successful install, run:
    ipsec verify

   You should see at least:
    Checking your system to see if IPsec got installed and started correctly
    Version check and ipsec on-path                             [OK]
    Checking for KLIPS support in kernel                        [OK]
    Checking for RSA private key (/etc/ipsec.secrets)           [OK]
    Checking that pluto is running                              [OK]

   If any of these first four checks fails, see our[1915] troubleshooting
   guide.

Making FreeS/WAN play well with others

   There are at least a couple of things on your system that might
   interfere with FreeS/WAN, and now's a good time to check these:
     * Firewalling. You need to allow UDP 500 through your firewall, plus
       ESP (protocol 50) and AH (protocol 51). For more information, see
       our updated firewalls document (coming soon).
     * Network address translation. Do not NAT the packets you will be
       tunneling.

Configure for your needs

   You'll need to configure FreeS/WAN for your local site. Have a look at
   our[1916] opportunism quickstart guide to see if that easy method is
   right for your needs. Or, see how to[1917] configure a
   network-to-network or Road Warrior style VPN.
     _________________________________________________________________

                          How to configure FreeS/WAN

   This page will teach you how to configure a simple network-to-network
   link or a Road Warrior connection between two Linux FreeS/WAN boxes.

   See also these related documents:
     * our[1918] quickstart guide to[1919] opportunistic encryption
     * our guide to configuration with[1920] policy groups
     * our[1921] advanced configuration document

   The network-to-network setup allows you to connect two office networks
   into one Virtual Private Network, while the Road Warrior connection
   secures a laptop's telecommute to work. Our examples also show the
   basic procedure on the Linux FreeS/WAN side where another IPsec peer
   is in play.

   Shortcut to[1922] net-to-net.
   Shortcut to[1923] Road Warrior.

Requirements

   To configure the network-to-network connection you must have:
     * two Linux gateways with static IPs
     * a network behind each gate. Networks must have non-overlapping IP
       ranges.
     * Linux FreeS/WAN[1924] installed on both gateways
     * [1925]tcpdump on the local gate, to test the connection

   For the Road Warrior you need:
     * one Linux box with a static IP
     * a Linux laptop with a dynamic IP
     * Linux FreeS/WAN installed on both
     * for testing, tcpdump on your gateway or laptop

   If both IPs are dynamic, your situation is a bit trickier. Your best
   bet is a variation on the[1926] Road Warrior, as described in[1927]
   this mailing list message.

Net-to-Net connection

  Gather information

   For each gateway, compile the following information:
     * gateway IP
     * IP range of the subnet you will be protecting. This doesn't have
       to be your whole physical subnet.
     * a name by which that gateway can identify itself for IPsec
       negotiations. Its form is a Fully Qualified Domain Name preceded
       by an @ sign, ie. @xy.example.com.
       It does not need to be within a domain that you own. It can be a
       made-up name.

    Get your leftrsasigkey

   On your local Linux FreeS/WAN gateway, print your IPsec public key:
    ipsec showhostkey --left

   The output should look like this (with the key shortened for easy
   reading):
    # RSA 2048 bits   xy.example.com   Fri Apr 26 15:01:41 2002
    leftrsasigkey=0sAQOnwiBPt...

   Don't have a key? Use[1928] ipsec newhostkey to create one.

    ...and your rightrsasigkey

   Get a console on the remote side:
    ssh2 ab.example.com

   In that window, type:
    ipsec showhostkey --right

   You'll see something like:
    # RSA 2192 bits   ab.example.com   Thu May 16 15:26:20 2002
    rightrsasigkey=0sAQOqH55O...

  Edit /etc/ipsec.conf

   Back on the local gate, copy our template to /etc/ipsec.conf . (on
   Mandrake, /etc/freeswan/ipsec.conf). Substitute the information you've
   gathered for our example data.
conn net-to-net
    left=192.0.2.2                 # Local vitals
    leftsubnet=192.0.2.128/29      #
    leftid=@xy.example.com         #
    leftrsasigkey=0s1LgR7/oUM...   #
    leftnexthop=%defaultroute      # correct in many situations
    right=192.0.2.9                # Remote vitals
    rightsubnet=10.0.0.0/24        #
    rightid=@ab.example.com        #
    rightrsasigkey=0sAQOqH55O...   #
    rightnexthop=%defaultroute     # correct in many situations
    auto=add                       # authorizes but doesn't start this
                                   # connection at startup

   "Left" and "right" should represent the machines that have FreeS/WAN
   installed on them, and "leftsubnet" and "rightsubnet" machines that
   are being protected. /32 is assumed for left/right and
   left/rightsubnet parameters.

   Copy conn net-to-net to the remote-side /etc/ipsec.conf. If you've
   made no other modifications to either ipsec.conf, simply:
    scp2 ipsec.conf root@ab.example.com:/etc/ipsec.conf

  Start your connection

   Locally, type:
    ipsec auto --up net-to-net

   You should see:
    104 "net-net" #223: STATE_MAIN_I1: initiate
    106 "net-net" #223: STATE_MAIN_I2: sent MI2, expecting MR2
    108 "net-net" #223: STATE_MAIN_I3: sent MI3, expecting MR3
    004 "net-net" #223: STATE_MAIN_I4: ISAKMP SA established
    112 "net-net" #224: STATE_QUICK_I1: initiate
    004 "net-net" #224: STATE_QUICK_I2: sent QI2, IPsec SA established

   The important thing is IPsec SA established. If you're unsuccessful,
   see our[1929] troubleshooting tips.

  Do not MASQ or NAT packets to be tunneled

   If you are using[1930] IP masquerade or[1931] Network Address
   Translation (NAT) on either gateway, you must now exempt the packets
   you wish to tunnel from this treatment. For example, if you have a
   rule like:
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -s 10.0.0.0/24 -j MASQUERADE

   change it to something like:
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -s 10.0.0.0/24 -d \! 192.0.2.128/29 -j M
ASQUERADE

   This may be necessary on both gateways.

  Test your connection

   Sit at one of your local subnet nodes (not the gateway), and ping a
   subnet node on the other (again, not the gateway).
    ping fileserver.toledo.example.com

   While still pinging, go to the local gateway and snoop your outgoing
   interface, for example:
    tcpdump -i ppp0

   You want to see ESP (Encapsulating Security Payload) packets moving
   back and forth between the two gateways at the same frequency as your
   pings:
    19:16:32.046220 192.0.2.2 > 192.0.2.9: ESP(spi=0x3be6c4dc,seq=0x3)
    19:16:32.085630 192.0.2.9 > 192.0.2.2: ESP(spi=0x5fdd1cf8,seq=0x6)

   If you see this, congratulations are in order! You have a tunnel which
   will protect any IP data from one subnet to the other, as it passes
   between the two gates. If not, go and[1932] troubleshoot.

   Note: your new tunnel protects only net-net traffic, not
   gateway-gateway, or gateway-subnet. If you need this (for example, if
   machines on one net need to securely contact a fileserver on the IPsec
   gateway), you'll need to create[1933] extra connections .

  Finishing touches

   Now that your connection works, name it something sensible, like:
conn winstonnet-toledonet

   To have the tunnel come up on-boot, replace
    auto=add

   with:
    auto=start

   Copy these changes to the other side, for example:
    scp2 ipsec.conf root@ab.example.com:/etc/ipsec.conf

   Enjoy!

Road Warrior Configuration

  Gather information

   You'll need to know:
     * the gateway's static IP
     * the IP range of the subnet behind that gateway
     * a name by which each side can identify itself for IPsec
       negotiations. Its form is a Fully Qualified Domain Name preceded
       by an @ sign, ie. @road.example.com.
       It does not need to be within a domain that you own. It can be a
       made-up name.

    Get your leftrsasigkey...

   On your laptop, print your IPsec public key:
    ipsec showhostkey --left

   The output should look like this (with the key shortened for easy
   reading):
    # RSA 2192 bits   road.example.com   Sun Jun  9 02:45:02 2002
    leftrsasigkey=0sAQPIPN9uI...

   Don't have a key? See[1934] these instructions.

    ...and your rightrsasigkey

   Get a console on the gateway:
    ssh2 xy.example.com

   View the gateway's public key with:
    ipsec showhostkey --right

   This will yield something like
    # RSA 2048 bits   xy.example.com   Fri Apr 26 15:01:41 2002
    rightrsasigkey=0sAQOnwiBPt...

  Customize /etc/ipsec.conf

   On your laptop, copy this template to /etc/ipsec.conf. (on Mandrake,
   /etc/freeswan/ipsec.conf). Substitute the information you've gathered
   for our example data.
conn road
    left=%defaultroute             # Picks up our dynamic IP
    leftnexthop=%defaultroute      #
    leftid=@road.example.com       # Local information
    leftrsasigkey=0sAQPIPN9uI...   #
    right=192.0.2.10               # Remote information
    rightsubnet=10.0.0.0/24        #
    rightid=@xy.example.com        #
    rightrsasigkey=0sAQOnwiBPt...  #
    auto=add                       # authorizes but doesn't start this
                                   # connection at startup

   The template for the gateway is different. Notice how it reverses left
   and right, in keeping with our convention that Left is Local, Right
   Remote. Be sure to switch your rsasigkeys in keeping with this.
    ssh2 xy.example.com
    vi /etc/ipsec.conf

   and add:
conn road
    left=192.0.2.2                 # Gateway's information
    leftid=@xy.example.com         #
    leftsubnet=192.0.2.128/29      #
    leftrsasigkey=0sAQOnwiBPt...   #
    rightnexthop=%defaultroute     # correct in many situations
    right=%any                     # Wildcard: we don't know the laptop's IP
    rightid=@road.example.com      #

    auto=add                       # authorizes but doesn't start this
                                   # connection at startup

  Start your connection

   You must start the connection from the Road Warrior side. On your
   laptop, type:
    ipsec auto --start net-to-net

   You should see:
104 "net-net" #223: STATE_MAIN_I1: initiate
106 "road" #301: STATE_MAIN_I2: sent MI2, expecting MR2
108 "road" #301: STATE_MAIN_I3: sent MI3, expecting MR3
004 "road" #301: STATE_MAIN_I4: ISAKMP SA established
112 "road" #302: STATE_QUICK_I1: initiate
004 "road" #302: STATE_QUICK_I2: sent QI2, IPsec SA established

   Look for IPsec SA established. If you're unsuccessful, see our[1935]
   troubleshooting tips.

  Do not MASQ or NAT packets to be tunneled

   If you are using[1936] IP masquerade or[1937] Network Address
   Translation (NAT) on either gateway, you must now exempt the packets
   you wish to tunnel from this treatment. For example, if you have a
   rule like:
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -s 10.0.0.0/24 -j MASQUERADE

   change it to something like:
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -s 10.0.0.0/24 -d \! 192.0.2.128/29 -j M
ASQUERADE

  Test your connection

   From your laptop, ping a subnet node behind the remote gateway. Do not
   choose the gateway itself for this test.
    ping ns.winston.example.com

   Snoop the packets exiting the laptop, with a command like:
    tcpdump -i wlan0

   You have success if you see (Encapsulating Security Payload) packets
   travelling in both directions:
    19:16:32.046220 192.0.2.2 > 192.0.2.9: ESP(spi=0x3be6c4dc,seq=0x3)
    19:16:32.085630 192.0.2.9 > 192.0.2.2: ESP(spi=0x5fdd1cf8,seq=0x6)

   If you do, great! Traffic between your Road Warrior and the net behind
   your gateway is protected. If not, see our[1938] troubleshooting
   hints.

   Your new tunnel protects only traffic addressed to the net, not to the
   IPsec gateway itself. If you need the latter, you'll want to make
   an[1939] extra tunnel..

  Finishing touches

   On both ends, name your connection wisely, like:
conn mike-to-office

   On the laptop only, replace
    auto=add

   with:
    auto=start

   so that you'll be connected on-boot.

   Happy telecommuting!

  Multiple Road Warriors

   If you're using RSA keys, as we did in this example, you can add as
   many Road Warriors as you like. The left/rightid parameter lets Linux
   FreeS/WAN distinguish between multiple Road Warrior peers, each with
   its own public key.

   The situation is different for shared secrets (PSK). During a PSK
   negotiation, ID information is not available at the time Pluto is
   trying to determine which secret to use, so, effectively, you can only
   define one Roadwarrior connection. All your PSK road warriors must
   therefore share one secret.

What next?

   Using the principles illustrated here, you can try variations such as:
     * a telecommuter with a static IP
     * a road warrior with a subnet behind it

   Or, look at some of our[1940] more complex configuration examples..

                          Linux FreeS/WAN background

   This section discusses a number of issues which have three things in
   common:
     * They are not specifically FreeS/WAN problems
     * You may have to understand them to get FreeS/WAN working right
     * They are not simple questions

   Grouping them here lets us provide the explanations some users will
   need without unduly complicating the main text.

   The explanations here are intended to be adequate for FreeS/WAN
   purposes (please comment to the[1941] users mailing list if you don't
   find them so), but they are not trying to be complete or definitive.
   If you need more information, see the references provided in each
   section.

Some DNS background

   [1942]Opportunistic encryption requires that the gateway systems be
   able to fetch public keys, and other IPsec-related information, from
   each other's DNS (Domain Name Service) records.

   [1943]DNS is a distributed database that maps names to IP addresses
   and vice versa.

   Much good reference material is available for DNS, including:
     * the[1944] DNS HowTo
     * the standard[1945] DNS reference book
     * [1946]Linux Network Administrator's Guide
     * [1947]BIND overview
     * [1948]BIND 9 Administrator's Reference

   We give only a brief overview here, intended to help you use DNS for
   FreeS/WAN purposes.

  Forward and reverse maps

   Although the implementation is distributed, it is often useful to
   speak of DNS as if it were just two enormous tables:
     * the forward map: look up a name, get an IP address
     * the reverse map: look up an IP address, get a name

   Both maps can optionally contain additional data. For opportunistic
   encryption, we insert the data need for IPsec authentication.

   A system named gateway.example.com with IP address 10.20.30.40 should
   have at least two DNS records, one in each map:

   gateway.example.com. IN A 10.20.30.40
          used to look up the name and get an IP address

   40.30.20.10.in-addr.arpa. IN PTR gateway.example.com.
          used for reverse lookups, looking up an address to get the
          associated name. Notice that the digits here are in reverse
          order; the actual address is 10.20.30.40 but we use 40.30.20.10
          here.

  Hierarchy and delegation

   For both maps there is a hierarchy of DNS servers and a system of
   delegating authority so that, for example:
     * the DNS administrator for example.com can create entries of the
       form name.example.com
     * the example.com admin cannot create an entry for
       counterexample.com; only someone with authority for .com can do
       that
     * an admin might have authority for 20.10.in-addr.arpa.
     * in either map, authority can be delegated
          + the example.com admin could give you authority for
            westcoast.example.com
          + the 20.10.in-addr.arpa admin could give you authority for
            30.20.10.in-addr.arpa

   DNS zones are the units of delegation. There is a hierarchy of zones.

  Syntax of DNS records

   Returning to the example records:
        gateway.example.com. IN A 10.20.30.40
        40.30.20.10.in-addr.arpa. IN PTR gateway.example.com.

   some syntactic details are:
     * the IN indicates that these records are for In ternet addresses
     * The final periods in '.com.' and '.arpa.' are required. They
       indicate the root of the domain name system.

   The capitalised strings after IN indicate the type of record. Possible
   types include:
     * Address, for forward lookups
     * PoinTeR, for reverse lookups
     * Canonical NAME, records to support aliasing, multiple names for
       one address
     * Mail eXchange, used in mail routing
     * SIGnature, used in[1949] secure DNS
     * KEY, used in[1950] secure DNS
     * TeXT, a multi-purpose record type

   To set up for opportunistic encryption, you add some TXT records to
   your DNS data. Details are in our[1951] quickstart document.

  Cacheing, TTL and propagation delay

   DNS information is extensively cached. With no caching, a lookup by
   your system of "www.freeswan.org" might involve:
     * your system asks your nameserver for "www.freeswan.org"
     * local nameserver asks root server about ".org", gets reply
     * local nameserver asks .org nameserver about "freeswan.org", gets
       reply
     * local nameserver asks freeswan.org nameserver about
       "www.freeswan.org", gets reply

   However, this can be a bit inefficient. For example, if you are in the
   Phillipines, the closest a root server is in Japan. That might send
   you to a .org server in the US, and then to freeswan.org in Holland.
   If everyone did all those lookups every time they clicked on a web
   link, the net would grind to a halt.

   Nameservers therefore cache information they look up. When you click
   on another link at www.freeswan.org, your local nameserver has the IP
   address for that server in its cache, and no further lookups are
   required.

   Intermediate results are also cached. If you next go to
   lists.freeswan.org, your nameserver can just ask the freeswan.org
   nameserver for that address; it does not need to query the root or
   .org nameservers because it has a cached address for the freeswan.org
   zone server.

   Of course, like any cacheing mechanism, this can create problems of
   consistency. What if the administrator for freeswan.org changes the IP
   address, or the authentication key, for www.freeswan.org? If you use
   old information from the cache, you may get it wrong. On the other
   hand, you cannot afford to look up fresh information every time. Nor
   can you expect the freeswan.org server to notify you; that isn't in
   the protocols.

   The solution that is in the protocols is fairly simple. Cacheable
   records are marked with Time To Live (TTL) information. When the time
   expires, the caching server discards the record. The next time someone
   asks for it, the server fetches a fresh copy. Of course, a server may
   also discard records before their TTL expires if it is running out of
   cache space.

   This implies that there will be some delay before the new version of a
   changed record propagates around the net. Until the TTLs on all copies
   of the old record expire, some users will see it because that is what
   is in their cache. Other users may see the new record immediately
   because they don't have an old one cached.

Problems with packet fragmentation

   It seems, from mailing list reports, to be moderately common for
   problems to crop up in which small packets pass through the IPsec
   tunnels just fine but larger packets fail.

   These problems are caused by various devices along the way
   mis-handling either packet fragments or[1952] path MTU discovery.

   IPsec makes packets larger by adding an ESP or AH header. This can
   tickle assorted bugs in fragment handling in routers and firewalls, or
   in path MTU discovery mechanisms, and cause a variety of symptoms
   which are both annoying and, often, quite hard to diagnose.

   An explanation from project technical lead Henry Spencer:
The problem is IP fragmentation; more precisely, the problem is that the
second, third, etc. fragments of an IP packet are often difficult for
filtering mechanisms to classify.

Routers cannot rely on reassembling the packet, or remembering what was in
earlier fragments, because the fragments may be out of order or may even
follow different routes.  So any general, worst-case filtering decision
pretty much has to be made on each fragment independently.  (If the router
knows that it is the only route to the destination, so all fragments
*must* pass through it, reassembly would be possible... but most routers
don't want to bother with the complications of that.)

All fragments carry roughly the original IP header, but any higher-level
header is (for IP purposes) just the first part of the packet data... so
only the first fragment carries that.  So, for example, on examining the
second fragment of a TCP packet, you could tell that it's TCP, but not
what port number it is destined for -- that information is in the TCP
header, which appears in the first fragment only.

The result of this classification difficulty is that stupid routers and
over-paranoid firewalls may just throw fragments away.  To get through
them, you must reduce your MTU enough that fragmentation will not occur.
(In some cases, they might be willing to attempt reassembly, but have very
limited resources to devote to it, meaning that packets must be small and
fragments few in number, leading to the same conclusion:  smaller MTU.)

   In addition to the problem Henry describes, you may also have trouble
   with[1953] path MTU discovery.

   By default, FreeS/WAN uses a large[1954] MTU for the ipsec device.
   This avoids some problems, but may complicate others. Here's an
   explanation from Claudia:
Here are a couple of pieces of background information. Apologies if you
have seen these already. An excerpt from one of my old posts:

    An MTU of 16260 on ipsec0 is usual. The IPSec device defaults to this
    high MTU so that it does not fragment incoming packets before encryption
    and encapsulation. If after IPSec processing packets are larger than 1500,
    [ie. the mtu of eth0] then eth0 will fragment them.

    Adding IPSec headers adds a certain number of bytes to each packet.
    The MTU of the IPSec interface refers to the maximum size of the packet
    before the IPSec headers are added. In some cases, people find it helpful
    to set ipsec0's MTU to 1500-(IPSec header size), which IIRC is about 1430.

    That way, the resulting encapsulated packets don't exceed 1500. On most
    networks, packets less than 1500 will not need to be fragmented.

and... (from Henry Spencer)

    The way it *ought* to work is that the MTU advertised by the ipsecN
    interface should be that of the underlying hardware interface, less a
    pinch for the extra headers needed.

    Unfortunately, in certain situations this breaks many applications.
    There is a widespread implicit assumption that the smallest MTUs are
    at the ends of paths, not in the middle, and another that MTUs are
    never less than 1500.  A lot of code is unprepared to handle paths
    where there is an "interior minimum" in the MTU, especially when it's
    less than 1500. So we advertise a big MTU and just let the resulting
    big packets fragment.

This usually works, but we do get bitten in cases where some intermediate
point can't handle all that fragmentation.  We can't win on this one.

   The MTU can be changed with an overridemtu= statement in the config
   setup section of[1955] ipsec.conf.5.

   For a discussion of MTU issues and some possible solutions using Linux
   advanced routing facilities, see the[1956] Linux 2.4 Advanced Routing
   HOWTO. For a discussion of MTU and NAT (Network Address Translation),
   see[1957] James Carter's MTU notes.

Network address translation (NAT)

   Network Address T ranslation is a service provided by some gateway
   machines. Calling it NAPT (adding the word Port) would be more
   precise, but we will follow the widespread usage.

   A gateway doing NAT rewrites the headers of packets it is forwarding,
   changing one or more of:
     * source address
     * source port
     * destination address
     * destination port

   On Linux 2.4, NAT services are provided by the[1958] netfilter(8)
   firewall code. There are several[1959] Netfilter HowTos including one
   on NAT.

   For older versions of Linux, this was referred to as "IP masquerade"
   and different tools were used. See this[1960] resource page.

   Putting an IPsec gateway behind a NAT gateway is not recommended. See
   our[1961] firewalls document.

  NAT to non-routable addresses

   The most common application of NAT uses private[1962] non-routable
   addresses.

   Often a home or small office network will have:
     * one connection to the Internet
     * one assigned publicly visible IP address
     * several machines that all need access to the net

   Of course this poses a problem since several machines cannot use one
   address. The best solution might be to obtain more addresses, but
   often this is impractical or uneconomical.

   A common solution is to have:
     * [1963]non-routable addresses on the local network
     * the gateway machine doing NAT
     * all packets going outside the LAN rewritten to have the gateway as
       their source address

   The client machines are set up with reserved[1964] non-routable IP
   addresses defined in RFC 1918. The masquerading gateway, the machine
   with the actual link to the Internet, rewrites packet headers so that
   all packets going onto the Internet appear to come from one IP
   address, that of its Internet interface. It then gets all the replies,
   does some table lookups and more header rewriting, and delivers the
   replies to the appropriate client machines.

   As far as anyone else on the Internet is concerned, the systems behind
   the gateway are completely hidden. Only one machine with one IP
   address is visible.

   For IPsec on such a gateway, you can entirely ignore the NAT in:
     * [1965]ipsec.conf(5)
     * firewall rules affecting your Internet-side interface

   Those can be set up exactly as they would be if your gateway had no
   other systems behind it.

   You do, however, have to take account of the NAT in firewall rules
   which affect packet forwarding.

  NAT to routable addresses

   NAT to routable addresses is also possible, but is less common and may
   make for rather tricky routing problems. We will not discuss it here.
   See the[1966] Netfilter HowTos.

   scripts or configuration files for use with FreeS/WAN.

   So far it has only one entry.

Poltorak's Firewall script

From: Poltorak Serguei <poltorak@dataforce.net>
Subject: [Users] Using FreeS/WAN
Date: Tue, 16 Oct 2001

Hello.

I'm using FreeS/WAN IPsec for half a year. I learned a lot of things about
it and I think it would be interesting for someone to see the result of my
experiments and usage of FreeS/WAN. If you find a mistake in this
file, please e-mail me. And excuse me for my english... I'm learning.. :)

I'll talk about vary simple configuration:

addresses prefix = 192.168

    lan1          sgw1     .0.0/24 (Internet)       sgw2            lan2
  .1.0/24---[ .1.1 ; .0.1 ]===================[ .0.10 ; . 2.10 ]---.2.0/24


We need to let lan1 see lan2 across Internet like it is behind sgw1. The
same for lan2. And we need to do IPX bridge for Novel Clients and NDS
synchronization.

my config:
------------------- ipsec.conf -------------------
conn lan1-lan2
        type=tunnel
        compress=yes
        #-------------------
        left=192.168.0.1
        leftsubnet=192.168.1.0/24
        #-------------------
        right=192.168.0.10
        rightsubnet=192.168.2.0/24
        #-------------------
        auth=esp
        authby=secret
--------------- end of ipsec.conf ----------------

ping .2.x from .1.y   (y != 1)
It works?? Fine. Let's continue...

Why y != 1 ?? Because kernel of sgw1 have 2 IP addresses and it will choose
the first IP (which is used to go to Internet) .0.1 and the packet won't go
through IPsec tunnel :(  But if do ping on .1.1 kernel will respond from
that address (.1.1) and the packet will be tunneled. The same problem occurred
then
.2.x sends a packet to .1.2 which is down at the moment. What happens? .1.1
sends ARP requesting .1.2... after 3 tries it send to .2.x an destunreach,
but from his "natural" IP or .0.1 . So the error message won't be delivered!
It's a big problem...

Resolution... One can manipulate with ipsec0 or ipsec0:0 to solve the
problem (if ipsec0 has .1.1 kernel will send packets correctly), but there
are powerful and elegant iproute2 :) We simply need to change source address
of packet that goes to other secure lan. This is done with

ip route replace 192.168.2.0/24 via 192.168.0.10 dev ipsec0 src 192.168.1.1

Cool!! Now it works!!

The second step. We want install firewall on sgw1 and sgw2. Encryption of
traffic without security isn't a good idea. I don't use {left|right}firewall,
because I'm running firewall from init scripts.

We want IPsec data between lan1-lan2, some ICMP errors (destination
unreachable, TTL exceeded, parameter problem and source quench), replying on
pings from both lans and Internet, ipxtunnel data for IPX and of course SSH
between sgw1 and sgw2 and from/to one specified host.

I'm using ipchains. With iptables there are some changes.

This explain how a packet traverse TCP/IP stack in IPsec capable kernel.

FIX ME, please, if there are any errors

Test the new firewall now.


Now about IPX. I tried 3 programs for tunneling IPX: tipxd, SIB and ipxtunnel

tipxd didn't send packets.. :(
SIB and ipxtunnel worked fine :)
With ipxtunnel there was a little problem. In sources there are an error.

--------------------- in main.c ------------------------
<       bytes += p.len;
---
>       bytes += len;
--------------------------------------------------------

After this FIX everything goes right...

------------------- /etc/ipxtunnel.conf ----------------
port    2005
remote  192.168.101.97    2005
interface eth1
--------------- end of /etc/ipxtunnel.conf -------------

I use IPX tunnel between .1.1 and .2.10 so we don't need to encrypt nor
authenticate encapsulated IPX packets, it is done with IPsec.

If you don't wont to use iproute2 to change source IP you need to use SIB
(it is able to bind local address) or establish tunnel between .0.1 and
.0.10 (external IPs, you need to do encryption in the program, but it isn't
strong).

For now I'm using ipxtunnel.

I think that's all for the moment. If there are any error, please e-mail me:
poltorak@df.ru . It would be cool if someone puts the scheme of TCP/IP in
kernel and firewall example on FreeS/WAN's manual pages.

                     How to configure to use "make check"

What is "make check"

   "make check" is a target in the top level makefile. It takes care of
   running a number of unit and system tests to confirm that FreeSWAN has
   been compiled correctly, and that no new bugs have been introduced.

   As FreeSWAN contains both kernel and userspace components, doing
   testing of FreeSWAN requires that the kernel be simulated. This is
   typically difficult to do as a kernel requires that it be run on bare
   hardware. A technology has emerged that makes this simpler. This
   is[1967] User Mode Linux.

   User-Mode Linux is a way to build a Linux kernel such that it can run
   as a process under another Linux (or in the future other) kernel.
   Presently, this can only be done for 2.4 guest kernels. The host
   kernel can be 2.2 or 2.4.

   "make check" expects to be able to build User-Mode Linux kernels with
   FreeSWAN included. To do this it needs to have some files downloaded
   and extracted prior to running "make check". This is described in
   the[1968] UML testing document.

   After having run the example in the UML testing document and
   successfully brought up the four machine combination, you are ready to
   use "make check"

Running "make check"

   "make check" works by walking the FreeSWAN source tree invoking the
   "check" target at each node. At present there are tests defined only
   for the klips directory. These tests will use the UML infrastructure
   to test out pieces of the klips code.

   The results of the tests can be recorded. If the environment variable
   $REGRESSRESULTS is non-null, then the results of each test will be
   recorded. This can be used as part of a nightly regression testing
   system, see[1969] Nightly testing for more details.

   "make check" otherwise prints a minimal amount of output for each
   test, and indicates pass/fail status of each test as they are run.
   Failed tests do not cause failure of the target in the form of exit
   codes.

                       How to write a "make check" test

Structure of a test

   Each test consists of a set of directories under testing/ . There are
   directories for klips, pluto, packaging and libraries. Each directory
   has a list of tests to run is stored in a file called TESTLIST in that
   directory. e.g. testing/klips/TESTLIST.

The TESTLIST

   This isn't actually a shell script. It just looks like one. Some tools
   other than /bin/sh process it. Lines that start with # are comments.
# test-kind     directory-containing-test       expectation     [PR#]

   The first word provides the test type, detailed below.

   The second word is the name of the test to run. This the directory in
   which the test case is to be found..

   The third word may be one of:

   blank/good
          the test is believed to function, report failure

   bad
          the test is known to fail, report unexpected success

   suspended
          the test should not be run

   The fourth word may be a number, which is a PR# if the test is
   failing.

Test kinds

   The test types are:

   skiptest
          means run no test.

   ctltest
          means run a single system without input/output.

   klipstest
          means run a single system with input/output networks

   [1970]umlplutotest
          means run a pair of systems

   [1971]umlXhost
          run an arbitrary number of systems

   suntest (TBD)
          means run a quad of east/west/sunrise/sunset

   roadtest (TBD)
          means run a trio of east-sunrise + warrior

   extrudedtest (TBD)
          means run a quad of east-sunrise + warriorsouth + park

   mkinsttest
          a test of the "make install" machinery.

   kernel_test_patch
          a test of the "make kernelpatch" machinery.

   Tests marked (TBD) have yet to be fully defined.

   Each test directory has a file in it called testparams.sh . This file
   sets a number of environment variables to define the parameters of the
   test.

Common parameters

   TESTNAME
          the name of the test (repeated for checking purposes)

   TEST_TYPE
          the type of the test (repeat of type type above)

   TESTHOST
          the name of the UML machine to run for the test, typically
          "east" or "west"

   TEST_PURPOSE
          The purpose of the test is one of:

        goal
                The goal purpose is where a test is defined for code that
                is not yet finished. The test indicates when the goals
                have in fact been reached.

        regress
                This is a test to determine that a previously existing
                bug has been repaired. This test will initially be
                created to reproduce the bug in isolation, and then the
                bug will be fixed.

        exploit
                This is a set of packets/programs that causes a
                vulnerability to be exposed. It is a specific variation
                of the regress option.

   TEST_GOAL_ITEM
          in the case of a goal test, this is a reference to the
          requirements document

   TEST_PROB_REPORT
          in the case of regression test, this the problem report number
          from GNATS

   TEST_EXPLOIT_URL
          in the case of an exploit, this is a URL referencing the paper
          explaining the origin of the test and the origin of exploit
          software

   REF_CONSOLE_OUTPUT
          a file in the test directory that contains the sanitized
          console output against which to compare the output of the
          actual test.

   REF_CONSOLE_FIXUPS
          a list of scripts (found in klips/test/fixups) to apply to
          sanitize the console output of the machine under test. These
          are typically perl, awk or sed scripts that remove things in
          the kernel output that change each time the test is run and/or
          compiled.

   INIT_SCRIPT
          a file of commands that is fed into the virtual machine's
          console in single user mode prior to starting the tests. This
          file will usually set up any eroute's and SADB entries that are
          required for the test.

          Lines beginning with # are skipped. Blank lines are skipped.
          Otherwise, a shell prompted is waited for each time (consisting
          of \n#) and then the command is sent. Note that the prompt is
          waited for before the command and not after, so completion of
          the last command in the script is not required. This is often
          used to invoke a program to monitor the system, e.g. ipsec
          pf_key.

   RUN_SCRIPT
          a file of commands that is fed into the virtual machine's
          console in single user mode, before the packets are sent. On
          single machine tests, this script doesn't provide any more
          power than INIT_SCRIPT, but is implemented for consistency's
          sake.

   FINAL_SCRIPT
          a file of commands that is fed into the virtual machine's
          console in single user mode after the final packet is sent.
          Similar to INIT_SCRIPT, above. If not specified, then the
          single command "halt" is sent. If specified, then the script
          should end with a halt command to nicely shutdown the UML.

   CONSOLEDIFFDEBUG
          If set to "true" then the series of console fixups (see
          REF_CONSOLE_FIXUPS) will be output after it is constructed. (It
          should be set to "false", or unset otherwise)

   NETJIGDEBUG
          If set to "true" then the series of console fixups (see
          REF_CONSOLE_FIXUPS) will be output after it is constructed. (It
          should be set to "false", or unset otherwise)

   NETJIGTESTDEBUG
          If set to "netjig", then the results of talking to the
          uml_netjig will be printed to stderr during the test. In
          addition, the jig will be invoked with --debug, which causes it
          to log its process ID, and wait 60 seconds before continuing.
          This can be used if you are trying to debug the uml_netjig
          program itself.

   HOSTTESTDEBUG
          If set to "hosttest", then the results of taling to the
          consoles of the UMLs will be printed to stderr during the test.

   NETJIGWAITUSER
          If set to "waituser", then the scripts will wait forever for
          user input before they shut the tests down. Use this is if you
          are debugging through the kernel.

   PACKETRATE
          A number, in miliseconds (default is 500ms) at which packets
          will be replayed by the netjig.

KLIPStest paramaters

   The klipstest function starts a program (
   testing/utils/uml_netjig/uml_netjig) to setup a bunch of I/O sockets
   (that simulate network interfaces). It then exports the references to
   these sockets to the environment and invokes (using system()) a given
   script. It waits for the script to finish.

   The script invoked (testing/utils/host-test.tcl) is a TCL[1972] expect
   script that arranges to start the UML and configure it appropriately
   for the test. The configuration is done with the script given above
   for INIT_SCRIPT . The TCL script then forks, leaves the UML in the
   background and exits. uml_netjig continues. It then starts listening
   to the simulated network answering ARPs and inserting packets as
   appropriate.

   The klipstest function invokes uml_netjig with arguments to capture
   output from network interface(s) and insert packets as appropriate:

   PUB_INPUT
          a[1973] pcap file to feed in on the public (encrypted)
          interface. (typically, eth1)

   PRIV_INPUT
          a pcap file to feed in on the private (plain-text) interface
          (typically, eth0).

   REF_PUB_OUTPUT
          a text file containing tcpdump output. Packets on the public
          (eth1) interface are captured to a[1974] pcap file by
          uml_netjig. The klipstest function then uses tcpdump on the
          file to produce text output, which is compared to the file
          given.

   REF_PUB_FILTER
          a program that will filter the TCPDUMP output to do further
          processing. Defaults to "cat".

   REF_PRIV_OUTPUT
          a text file containing tcpdump output. Packets on the private
          (eth0) interface are captured and compared after conversion by
          tcpdump, as with REFPUBOUTPUT.

   REF_PRIV_FILTER
          a program that will filter the TCPDUMP output to do further
          processing. Defaults to "cat".

   EXITONEMPTY
          a flag for uml_netjig. It should contain "--exitonempty" of
          uml_netjig should exit when all of the input (
          PUBINPUT,PRIVINPUT) packets have been injected.

   ARPREPLY
          a flag for uml_netjig. It should contain "--arpreply" if
          uml_netjig should reply to ARP requests. One will typically set
          this to avoid having to fudge the ARP cache manually.

   TCPDUMPFLAGS
          a set of flags for the tcpdump used when converting captured
          output. Typical values will include "-n" to turn off DNS, and
          often "-E" to set the decryption key (tcpdump 3.7.1 and higher
          only) for ESP packets. The "-t" flag (turn off timestamps) is
          provided automatically

   NETJIG_EXTRA
          additional comments to be sent to the netjig. This may arrange
          to record or create additional networks, or may toggle options.

mkinsttest paramaters

   The basic concept of the mkinsttest test type is that it performs a
   "make install" to a temporary $DESTDIR. The resulting tree can then be
   examined to determine if it was done properly. The files can be
   uninstalled to determine if the file list was correct, or the contents
   of files can be examined more precisely.

   INSTALL_FLAGS
          If set, then an install will be done. This provides the set of
          flags to provide for the install. The target to be used
          (usually "install") must be among the flags.

   POSTINSTALL_SCRIPT
          If set, a script to run after initial "make install". Two
          arguments are provided: an absolute path to the root of the
          FreeSWAN src tree, and an absolute path to the temporary
          installation area.

   INSTALL2_FLAGS
          If set, a second install will be done using these flags.
          Similarly to INSTALL_FLAGS, the target must be among the flags.

   UNINSTALL_FLAGS
          If set, an uninstall will be done using these flags. Similarly
          to INSTALL_FLAGS, the target (usually "uninstall") must be
          among the flags.

   REF_FIND_f_l_OUTPUT
          If set, a find $ROOT ( -type f -or -type -l ) will be done to
          get a list of a real files and symlinks. The resulting file
          will be compared to the file listed by this option.

   REF_FILE_CONTENTS
          If set, it should point to a file containing records for the
          form:



reffile

samplefile

          one record per line. A diff between the provided reference
          file, and the sample file (located in the temporary
          installation root) will be done for each record.

rpm_build_install_test paramaters

   The rpm_build_install_test type is to verify that the proper packing
   list is produced by "make rpm", and that the mechanisms for building
   the kernel modules produce consistent results.

   RPM_KERNEL_SOURCE
          Point to an extracted copy of the RedHat kernel source code.
          Variables from the environment may be used.

   REF_RPM_CONTENTS
          This is a file containing one record per line. Each record
          consists of a RPM name (may contain wildcards) and a filename
          to compare the contents to. The RPM will be located and a file
          list will be produced with rpm2cpio.

libtest paramaters

   The libtest test is for testing library routines. The library file is
   expected to provided an #ifdef by the name of library . The libtest
   type invokes the C compiler to compile this file, links it against
   libfreeswan.a (to resolve any other dependancies) and runs the test
   with the -r argument to invoke a regression test.

   The library test case is expected to do a self-test, exiting with
   status code 0 if everything is okay, and with non-zero otherwise. A
   core dump (exit code greater than 128) is noted specifically.

   Unlike other tests, there are no subdirectories required, or other
   parameters to set.

umlplutotest paramaters

   The umlplutotest function starts a pair of user mode line processes.
   This is a 2-host version of umlXhost. The "EAST" and "WEST" slots are
   defined.

umlXhost parameters

   The umlXtest function starts an arbitrary number of user mode line
   processes.

   The script invoked (testing/utils/Xhost-test.tcl) is a TCL[1975]
   expect script that arranges to start each UML and configure it
   appropriately for the test. It then starts listening (using
   uml_netjig) to the simulated network answering ARPs and inserting
   packets as appropriate.

   umlXtest has a series of slots, each of which should be filled by a
   host. The list of slots is controlled by the variable, XHOST_LIST.
   This variable should be set to a space seperated list of slots. The
   former umlplutotest is now implemented as a variation of the umlXhost
   test, with XHOST_LIST="EAST WEST".

   For each host slot that is defined, a series of variables should be
   filled in, defining what configuration scripts to use for that host.

   The following are used to control the console input and output to the
   system. Where the string ${host} is present, the host slot should be
   filled in. I.e. for the two host system with XHOST_LIST="EAST WEST",
   then the variables: EAST_INIT_SCRIPT and WEST_INIT_SCRIPT will exist.

   ${host}HOST
          The name of the UML host which will fill this slot

   ${host}_INIT_SCRIPT
          a file of commands that is fed into the virtual machine's
          console in single user mode prior to starting the tests. This
          file will usually set up any eroute's and SADB entries that are
          required for the test. Similar to INIT_SCRIPT, above.

   ${host}_RUN_SCRIPT
          a file of commands that is fed into the virtual machine's
          console in single user mode, before the packets are sent. This
          set of commands is run after all of the virtual machines are
          initialized. I.e. after EAST_INIT_SCRIPT AND WEST_INIT_SCRIPT.
          This script can therefore do things that require that all
          machines are properly configured.

   ${host}_RUN2_SCRIPT
          a file of commands that is fed into the virtual machine's
          console in single user mode, after the packets are sent. This
          set of commands is run before any of the virtual machines have
          been shut down. (I.e. before EAST_FINAL_SCRIPT AND
          WEST_FINAL_SCRIPT.) This script can therefore catch
          post-activity status reports.

   ${host}_FINAL_SCRIPT
          a file of commands that is fed into the virtual machine's
          console in single user mode after the final packet is sent.
          Similar to INIT_SCRIPT, above. If not specified, then the
          single command "halt" is sent. Note that when this script is
          run, the other virtual machines may already have been killed.
          If specified, then the script should end with a halt command to
          nicely shutdown the UML.

   REF_${host}_CONSOLE_OUTPUT
          Similar to REF_CONSOLE_OUTPUT, above.

   Some additional flags apply to all hosts:

   REF_CONSOLE_FIXUPS
          a list of scripts (found in klips/test/fixups) to apply to
          sanitize the console output of the machine under test. These
          are typically perl, awk or sed scripts that remove things in
          the kernel output that change each time the test is run and/or
          compiled.

   In addition to input to the console, the networks may have input fed
   to them:

   EAST_INPUT/WEST_INPUT
          a[1976] pcap file to feed in on the private network side of
          each network. The "EAST" and "WEST" here refer to the networks,
          not the hosts.

   REF_PUB_FILTER
          a program that will filter the TCPDUMP output to do further
          processing. Defaults to "cat".

   REF_EAST_FILTER/REF_WEST_FILTER
          a program that will filter the TCPDUMP output to do further
          processing. Defaults to "cat". <

   TCPDUMPFLAGS
          a set of flags for the tcpdump used when converting captured
          output. Typical values will include "-n" to turn off DNS, and
          often "-E" to set the decryption key (tcpdump 3.7.1 and higher
          only) for ESP packets. The "-t" flag (turn off timestamps) is
          provided automatically

   REF_EAST_OUTPUT/REF_WEST_OUTPUT
          a text file containing tcpdump output. Packets on the private
          (eth0) interface are captured and compared after conversion by
          tcpdump, as with REF_PUB_OUTPUT.

          There are two additional environment variables that may be set
          on the command line:

        NETJIGVERBOSE=verbose export NETJIGVERBOSE
                If set, then the test output will be "chatty", and let
                you know what commands it is running, and as packets are
                sent. Without it set, the output is limited to
                success/failure messages.

        NETJIGTESTDEBUG=netjig export NETJIGTESTDEBUG
                This will enable debugging of the communication with
                uml_netjig, and turn on debugging in this utility. This
                does not imply NETJIGVERBOSE.

   HOSTTESTDEBUG=hosttest export HOSTTESTDEBUG
          This will show all interactions with the user-mode-linux
          consoles

kernel_patch_test paramaters

   The kernel_patch_test function takes some kernel source, copies it
   with lndir, and then applies the patch as produced by "make
   kernelpatch".

   The following are used to control the input and output to the system:

   KERNEL_NAME
          the kernel name, typically something like "linus" or "rh"

   KERNEL_VERSION
          the kernel version number, as in "2.2" or "2.4".

   KERNEL_${KERNEL_NAME}${KERNEL_VERSION}_SRC
          This variable should set in the environment, probably in
          ~/freeswan-regress-env.sh. Examples of this variables would be
          KERNEL_LINUS2_0_SRC or KERNEL_RH7_3_SRC. This variable should
          point to an extracted copy of the kernel source in question.

   REF_PATCH_OUTPUT
          a copy of the patch output to compare against

   KERNEL_PATCH_LEAVE_SOURCE
          If set to a non-empty string, then the patched kernel source is
          not removed at the end of the test. This will typically be set
          in the environment while debugging.

module_compile paramaters

   The module_compile test attempts to build the KLIPS module against a
   given set of kernel source. This is also done by the RPM tests, but in
   a very specific manner.

   There are two variations of this test - one where the kernel either
   doesn't need to be configured, or is already done, and tests were
   there is a local configuration file.

   Where the kernel doesn't need to be configured, the kernel source that
   is found is simply used. It may be a RedHat-style kernel, where one
   can cause it to configure itself via rhconfig.h-style definitions. Or,
   it may just be a kernel tree that has been configured.

   If the variable KERNEL_CONFIG_FILE is set, then a new directory is
   created for the kernel source. It is populated with lndir(1). The
   referenced file is then copied in as .config, and "make oldconfig" is
   used to configure the kernel. This resulting kernel is then used as
   the reference source.

   In all cases, the kernel source is found the same was for the
   kernelpatch test, i.e. via KERNEL_VERSION/KERNEL_NAME and
   KERNEL_${KERNEL_NAME}${KERNEL_VERSION}_SRC.

   Once there is kernel source, the module is compiled using the
   top-level "make module" target.

   The test is considered successful if an executable is found in
   OUTPUT/module/ipsec.o at the end of the test.

   KERNEL_NAME
          the kernel name, typically something like "linus" or "rh"

   KERNEL_VERSION
          the kernel version number, as in "2.2" or "2.4".

   KERNEL_${KERNEL_NAME}${KERNEL_VERSION}_SRC
          This variable should set in the environment, probably in
          ~/freeswan-regress-env.sh. Examples of this variables would be
          KERNEL_LINUS2_0_SRC or KERNEL_RH7_3_SRC. This variable should
          point to an extracted copy of the kernel source in question.

   KERNEL_CONFIG_FILE
          The configuration file for the kernel.

   KERNEL_PATCH_LEAVE_SOURCE
          If set to a non-empty string, then the configured kernel source
          is not removed at the end of the test. This will typically be
          set in the environment while debugging.

   MODULE_DEF_INCLUDE
          The include file that will be used to configure the KLIPS
          module, and possibly the kernel source.

                               Current pitfalls

   "tcpdump dissector" not available.
          This is a non-fatal warning. If uml_netjig is invoked with the
          -t option, then it will attempt to use tcpdump's dissector to
          decode each packet that it processes. The dissector is
          presently not available, so this option it normally turned off
          at compile time. The dissector library will be released with
          tcpdump version 4.0.
     _________________________________________________________________

                         User-Mode-Linux Testing guide

   User mode linux is a way to compile a linux kernel such that it can
   run as a process in another linux system (potentially as a *BSD or
   Windows process later). See[1977]
   http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net/

   UML is a good platform for testing and experimenting with FreeS/WAN.
   It allows several network nodes to be simulated on a single machine.
   Creating, configuring, installing, monitoring, and controling these
   nodes is generally easier and easier to script with UML than real
   hardware.

   You'll need about 500Mb of disk space for a full
   sunrise-east-west-sunset setup. You can possibly get this down by
   130Mb if you remove the sunrise/sunset kernel build. If you just want
   to run, then you can even remove the east/west kernel build.

   Nothing need be done as super user. In a couple of steps, we note
   where super user is required to install commands in system-wide
   directories, but ~/bin could be used instead. UML seems to use a
   system-wide /tmp/uml directory so different users may interfere with
   one another. Later UMLs use ~/.uml instead, so multiple users running
   UML tests should not be a problem, but note that a single user running
   the UML tests will only be able run one set. Further, UMLs sometimes
   get stuck and hang around. These "zombies" (most will actually be in
   the "T" state in the process table) will interfere with subsequent
   tests.

Preliminary Notes on BIND

   As of 2003/3/1, the Light-Weight Resolver is used by pluto. This
   requires that BIND9 be running. It also requires that BIND9
   development libraries be present in the build environment. The DNSSEC
   code is only truly functional in BIND9 snapshots. The library code
   could be 9.2.2, we believe. We are using BIND9 20021115 snapshot code
   from[1978] ftp://ftp.isc.org/isc/bind9/snapshots.

   FreeS/WAN may well require a newer BIND than is on your system. Many
   distributions have moved to BIND9.2.2 recently due to a security
   advisory. BIND is five components.
    1. named
    2. dnssec-*
    3. client side resolver libraries
    4. client side utility libraries I thought there were lib and named
       parts to dnsssec...
    5. dynamic DNS update utilities

   The only piece that we need for *building* is #4. That's the only part
   that has to be on the build host. What is the difference between
   resolver and util libs? If you want to edit
   testing/baseconfigs/all/etc/bind, you'll need a snapshot version. The
   resolver library contains the resolver. FreeS/WAN has its own copy of
   that in lib/liblwres.

Steps to Install UML for FreeS/WAN

    1. Get the following files:
         a. from[1979] http://www.sandelman.ottawa.on.ca/freeswan/uml/
            umlfreeroot-15.1.tar.gz (or highest numbered one). This is a
            debian potato root file system. You can use this even on a
            Redhat host, as it has the newer GLIBC2.2 libraries as well.
         b. From[1980] ftp://ftp.xs4all.nl/pub/crypto/freeswan/ a
            snapshot or release (1.92 or better)
         c. From a[1981] http://www.kernel.org mirror, the virgin 2.4.19
            kernel. Please realize that we have defaults in our tree for
            kernel configuration. We try to track the latest UML kernels.
            If you use a newer kernel, you may have faults in the kernel
            build process. You can see what the latest that is being
            regularly tested by visiting[1982] freeswan-regress-env.sh.
         d. Get[1983] http://ftp.nl.linux.org/uml/
            uml-patch-2.4.19-47.bz2 or the one associated with your
            kernel. As of 2003/03/05, uml-patch-2.4.19-47.bz2 works for
            us. More recent versions of the patch have not been tested by
            us.
         e. You'll probably want to visit[1984]
            http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net and get the UML
            utilities. These are not needed for the build or interactive
            use (but recommended). They are necessary for the regression
            testing procedures used by "make check". We currently use
            uml_utilities_20020212.tar.bz2.
         f. You need tcpdump version 3.7.1 or better. This is newer than
            the version included in most LINUX distributions. You can
            check the version of an installed tcpdump with the --version
            flag. If you need a newer tcpdump fetch both tcpdump and
            libpcap source tar files from[1985] http://www.tcpdump.org/
            or a mirror.
    2. Pick a suitable place, and extract the following files:
         a. 2.4.19 kernel. For instance:
            cd /c2/kernel
           tar xzvf ../download/pub/linux/kernel/v2.4/linux-2.4.19.tar.gz

         b. extract the umlfreeroot file
            mkdir -p /c2/user-mode-linux/basic-root
           cd /c2/user-mode-linux/basic-root
           tar xzvf ../download/umlfreeroot-15.1.tar.gz

         c. FreeSWAN itself (or checkout "all" from CVS)
            mkdir -p /c2/freeswan/sandbox
           cd /c2/freeswan/sandbox
           tar xzvf ../download/snapshot.tar.gz

    3. If you need to build a newer tcpdump:
          + Make sure you have OpenSSL installed -- it is needed for
            cryptographic routines.
          + Unpack libpcap and tcpdump source in parallel directories
            (the tcpdump build procedures look for libpcap next door).
          + Change directory into the libpcap source directory and then
            build the library:
        ./configure
        make

          + Change into the tcpdump source directory, build tcpdump, and
            install it.
        ./configure
        make
        # Need to be superuser to install in system directories.
        # Installing in ~/bin would be an alternative.
        su -c "make install"

    4. If you need the uml utilities, unpack them somewhere then build
       and install them:
        cd tools
        make all
        # Need to be superuser to install in system directories.
        # Installing in ~/bin would be an alternative.
        su -c "make install BIN_DIR=/usr/local/bin"

    5. set up the configuration file
          + cd /c2/freeswan/sandbox/freeswan-1.97/testing/utils
          + copy umlsetup-sample.sh to ../../umlsetup.sh: cp
            umlsetup-sample.sh ../../umlsetup.sh
          + open up ../../umlsetup.sh in your favorite editor.
          + change POOLSPACE= to point to the place with at least 500Mb
            of disk. Best if it is on the same partition as the
            "umlfreeroot" extraction, as it will attempt to use hard
            links if possible to save disk space.
          + Set TESTINGROOT if you intend to run the script outside of
            the sandbox/snapshot/release directory. Otherwise, it will
            configure itself.
          + KERNPOOL should point to the directory with your 2.4.19
            kernel tree. This tree should be unconfigured! This is the
            directory you used in step 2a.
          + UMLPATCH should point at the bz2 file you downloaded at 1d.
            If using a kernel that already includes the patch, set this
            to /dev/null.
          + FREESWANDIR should point at the directory where you unpacked
            the snapshot/release. Include the "freeswan-snap2001sep16b"
            or whatever in it. If you are running from CVS, then you
            point at the directory where top, klips, etc. are. The script
            will fix up the directory so that it can be used.
          + BASICROOT should be set to the directory used in 2b, or to
            the directory that you created with RPMs.
          + SHAREDIR should be set to the directory used in 2c, to
            /usr/share for Debian potato users, or to
            $BASICROOT/usr/share.
    6.
 cd $TESTINGROOT/utils
sh make-uml.sh
       It will grind for awhile. If there are errors it will bail. If so,
       run it under "script" and send the output to
       bugs@lists.freeswan.org.
    7. You will have a bunch of stuff under $POOLSPACE. Open four xterms:
     for i in sunrise sunset east west
    do
        xterm -name $i -title $i -e $POOLSPACE/$i/start.sh &    done
    8. Login as root. Password is "root" (Note, these virtual machines
       are networked together, but are not configured to talk to the rest
       of the world.)
    9. verify that pluto started on east/west, run "ipsec look"
   10. login to sunrise. run "ping sunset"
   11. login to west. run "tcpdump -p -i eth1 -n" (tcpdump must be
       version 3.7.1 or newer)
   12. Closing a console xterm will shut down that UML.
   13. You can "make check", if you want to. It is run from
       /c2/freeswan/sandbox/freeswan-1.97.

                         Debugging the kernel with GDB

   With User-Mode-Linux, you can debug the kernel using GDB. See
   http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net/debugging.html.

   Typically, one will want to address a test case for a failing
   situation. Running GDB from Emacs, or from other front ends is
   possible. First start GDB.

   Tell it to open the UMLPOOL/swan/linux program.

   Note the PID of GDB:
marajade-[projects/freeswan/mgmt/planning] mcr 1029 %ps ax | grep gdb
 1659 pts/9    SN     0:00 /usr/bin/gdb -fullname -cd /mara4/freeswan/kernpatch
/UMLPOOL/swan/ linux

   Set the following in the environment:
UML_east_OPT="debug gdb-pid=1659"

   Then start the user-mode-linux in the test scheme you wish:
marajade-[kernpatch/testing/klips/east-icmp-02] mcr 1220 %../../utils/runme.sh

   The user-mode-linux will stop on boot, giving you a chance to attach
   to the process:
(gdb) file linux
Reading symbols from linux...done.
(gdb) attach 1
Attaching to program: /mara4/freeswan/kernpatch/UMLPOOL/swan/linux, process 1
0xa0118bc1 in kill () at hostfs_kern.c:770

   At this point, break points should be created as appropriate.

Other notes about debugging

   If you are running a standard test, after all the packets are sent,
   the UML will be shutdown. This can cause problems, because the UML may
   get terminated while you are debugging.

   The environment variable NETJIGWAITUSER can be set to "waituser". If
   so, then the testing system will prompt before exiting the test.

                           User-Mode-Linux mysteries

     * running more than one UML of the same name (e.g. "west") can cause
       problems.
     * running more than one UML from the same root file system is not a
       good idea.
     * all this means that running "make check" twice on the same machine
       is probably not a good idea.
     * occationally, UMLs will get stuck. This can happen like: 15134 ? T
       0:00 /spare/hugh/uml/uml2.4.18-sept5/umlbuild/east/linux (east)
       [/bin/sh] 15138 ? T 0:00
       /spare/hugh/uml/uml2.4.18-sept5/umlbuild/east/linux (east) [halt]
       these will need to be killed. Note that they are in "T"racing
       mode.
     * UMLs can also hang, and will report "Tracing myself and I can't
       get out". This is a bug in UML. There are ways to find out what is
       going on and report this to the UML people, but we don't know the
       magic right now.

                       Getting more info from uml_netjig

   uml_netjig can be compiled with a built-in tcpdump. This uses
   not-yet-released code from[1986] www.tcpdump.org. Please see the
   instructions in testing/utils/uml_netjig/Makefile.

                     History and politics of cryptography

   Cryptography has a long and interesting history, and has been the
   subject of considerable political controversy.

Introduction

  History

   The classic book on the history of cryptography is David Kahn's[1987]
   The Codebreakers. It traces codes and codebreaking from ancient Egypt
   to the 20th century.

   Diffie and Landau[1988] Privacy on the Line: The Politics of
   Wiretapping and Encryption covers the history from the First World War
   to the 1990s, with an emphasis on the US.

    World War II

   During the Second World War, the British "Ultra" project achieved one
   of the greatest intelligence triumphs in the history of warfare,
   breaking many Axis codes. One major target was the Enigma cipher
   machine, a German device whose users were convinced it was
   unbreakable. The American "Magic" project had some similar triumphs
   against Japanese codes.

   There are many books on this period. See our bibliography for several.
   Two I particularly like are:
     * Andrew Hodges has done a superb[1989] biography of Alan Turing, a
       key player among the Ultra codebreakers. Turing was also an
       important computer pioneer. The terms[1990] Turing test and[1991]
       Turing machine are named for him, as is the[1992] ACM's highest
       technical[1993] award.
     * Neal Stephenson's[1994] Cryptonomicon is a novel with cryptography
       central to the plot. Parts of it take place during WW II, other
       parts today.

   Bletchley Park, where much of the Ultra work was done, now has a
   museum and a[1995] web site.

   The Ultra work introduced three major innovations.
     * The first break of Enigma was achieved by Polish Intelligence in
       1931. Until then most code-breakers had been linguists, but a
       different approach was needed to break machine ciphers. Polish
       Intelligence recruited bright young mathematicians to crack the
       "unbreakable" Enigma. When war came in 1939, the Poles told their
       allies about this, putting Britain on the road to Ultra. The
       British also adopted a mathematical approach.
     * Machines were extensively used in the attacks. First the Polish
       "Bombe" for attacking Enigma, then British versions of it, then
       machines such as Collosus for attacking other codes. By the end of
       the war, some of these machines were beginning to closely resemble
       digital computers. After the war, a team at Manchester University,
       several old Ultra hands included, built one of the world's first
       actual general-purpose digital computers.
     * Ultra made codebreaking a large-scale enterprise, producing
       intelligence on an industrial scale. This was not a "black
       chamber", not a hidden room in some obscure government building
       with a small crew of code-breakers. The whole operation -- from
       wholesale interception of enemy communications by stations around
       the world, through large-scale code-breaking and analysis of the
       decrypted material (with an enormous set of files for
       cross-referencing), to delivery of intelligence to field
       commanders -- was huge, and very carefully managed.

   So by the end of the war, Allied code-breakers were expert at
   large-scale mechanised code-breaking. The payoffs were enormous.

    Postwar and Cold War

   The wartime innovations were enthusiastically adopted by post-war and
   Cold War signals intelligence agencies. Presumably many nations now
   have some agency capable of sophisticated attacks on communications
   security, and quite a few engage in such activity on a large scale.

   America's[1996] NSA, for example, is said to be both the world's
   largest employer of mathematicians and the world's largest purchaser
   of computer equipment. Such claims may be somewhat exaggerated, but
   beyond doubt the NSA -- and similar agencies in other countries --
   have some excellent mathematicians, lots of powerful computers,
   sophisticated software, and the organisation and funding to apply them
   on a large scale. Details of the NSA budget are secret, but there are
   some published[1997] estimates.

   Changes in the world's communications systems since WW II have
   provided these agencies with new targets. Cracking the codes used on
   an enemy's military or diplomatic communications has been common
   practice for centuries. Extensive use of radio in war made large-scale
   attacks such as Ultra possible. Modern communications make it possible
   to go far beyond that. Consider listening in on cell phones, or
   intercepting electronic mail, or tapping into the huge volumes of data
   on new media such as fiber optics or satellite links. None of these
   targets existed in 1950. All of them can be attacked today, and almost
   certainly are being attacked.

   The Ultra story was not made public until the 1970s. Much of the
   recent history of codes and code-breaking has not been made public,
   and some of it may never be. Two important books are:
     * Bamford's[1998] The Puzzle Palace, a history of the NSA
     * Hager's[1999] Secret Power, about the[2000] Echelon system -- the
       US, UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand co-operating to monitor
       much of the world's communications.

   Note that these books cover only part of what is actually going on,
   and then only the activities of nations open and democratic enough
   that (some of) what they are doing can be discovered. A full picture,
   including:
     * actions of the English-speaking democracies not covered in those
       books
     * actions of other more-or-less sane governments
     * the activities of various more-or-less insane governments
     * possibilities for unauthorized action by government employees
     * possible actions by large non-government organisations:
       corporations, criminals, or conspiracies

   might be really frightening.

    Recent history -- the crypto wars

   Until quite recently, cryptography was primarily a concern of
   governments, especially of the military, of spies, and of diplomats.
   Much of it was extremely secret.

   In recent years, that has changed a great deal. With computers and
   networking becoming ubiquitous, cryptography is now important to
   almost everyone. Among the developments since the 1970s:
     * The US gov't established the Data Encryption Standard,[2001] DES,
       a[2002] block cipher for cryptographic protection of unclassfied
       documents.
     * DES also became widely used in industry, especially regulated
       industries such as banking.
     * Other nations produced their own standards, such as[2003] GOST in
       the Soviet Union.
     * [2004]Public key cryptography was invented by Diffie and Hellman.
     * Academic conferences such as[2005] Crypto and[2006] Eurocrypt
       began.
     * Several companies began offerring cryptographic products:[2007]
       RSA,[2008] PGP, the many vendors with[2009] PKI products, ...
     * Cryptography appeared in other products: operating systems, word
       processors, ...
     * Network protocols based on crypto were developed:[2010] SSH
       ,[2011] SSL,[2012] IPsec, ...
     * Crytography came into widespread use to secure bank cards,
       terminals, ...
     * The US government replaced[2013] DES with the much stronger
       Advanced Encryption Standard,[2014] AES

   This has led to a complex ongoing battle between various mainly
   government groups wanting to control the spread of crypto and various
   others, notably the computer industry and the[2015] cypherpunk crypto
   advocates, wanting to encourage widespread use.

   Steven Levy has written a fine history of much of this, called[2016]
   Crypto: How the Code rebels Beat the Government -- Saving Privacy in
   the Digital Age.

   The FreeS/WAN project is to a large extent an outgrowth of cypherpunk
   ideas. Our reasons for doing the project can be seen in these quotes
   from the[2017] Cypherpunk Manifesto:

     Privacy is necessary for an open society in the electronic age. ...

     We cannot expect governments, corporations, or other large,
     faceless organizations to grant us privacy out of their
     beneficence. It is to their advantage to speak of us, and we should
     expect that they will speak. ...

     We must defend our own privacy if we expect to have any. ...

     Cypherpunks write code. We know that someone has to write software
     to defend privacy, and since we can't get privacy unless we all do,
     we're going to write it. We publish our code so that our fellow
     Cypherpunks may practice and play with it. Our code is free for all
     to use, worldwide. We don't much care if you don't approve of the
     software we write. We know that software can't be destroyed and
     that a widely dispersed system can't be shut down.

     Cypherpunks deplore regulations on cryptography, for encryption is
     fundamentally a private act. ...

     For privacy to be widespread it must be part of a social contract.
     People must come and together deploy these systems for the common
     good. ...

   To quote project leader John Gilmore:

     We are literally in a race between our ability to build and deploy
     technology, and their ability to build and deploy laws and
     treaties. Neither side is likely to back down or wise up until it
     has definitively lost the race.

   If FreeS/WAN reaches its goal of making[2018] opportunistic encryption
   widespread so that secure communication can become the default for a
   large part of the net, we will have struck a major blow.

  Politics

   The political problem is that nearly all governments want to monitor
   their enemies' communications, and some want to monitor their
   citizens. They may be very interested in protecting some of their own
   communications, and often some types of business communication, but
   not in having everyone able to communicate securely. They therefore
   attempt to restrict availability of strong cryptography as much as
   possible.

   Things various governments have tried or are trying include:
     * Echelon, a monitor-the-world project of the US, UK, NZ, Australian
       and Canadian[2019] signals intelligence agencies. See this[2020]
       collection of links and this[2021] story on the French
       Parliament's reaction.
     * Others governments may well have their own Echelon-like projects.
       To quote the Dutch Minister of Defense, as reported in a
       German[2022] magazine:

     The government believes not only the governments associated with
     Echelon are able to intercept communication systems, but that it is
     an activity of the investigative authorities and intelligence
     services of many countries with governments of different political
     signature.
       Even if they have nothing on the scale of Echelon, most
       intelligence agencies and police forces certainly have some
       interception capability.
     * [2023]NSA tapping of submarine communication cables, described
       in[2024] this article
     * A proposal for international co-operation on[2025] Internet
       surveillance.
     * Alleged[2026] sabotage of security products by the[2027] NSA (the
       US signals intelligence agency).
     * The German armed forces and some government departments will stop
       using American software for fear of NSA "back doors", according to
       this[2028] news story .
     * The British Regulation of Investigatory Powers bill. See
       this[2029] web page. and perhaps this[2030] cartoon.
     * A Russian[2031] ban on cryptography
     * Chinese[2032] controls on net use.
     * The FBI's carnivore system for covert searches of email. See
       this[2033] news coverage and this[2034] risk assessment. The
       government had an external review of some aspects of this system
       done. See this[2035] analysis of that review. Possible defenses
       against Carnivore include:
          + [2036]PGP for end-to-end mail encryption
          + [2037]secure sendmail for server-to-server encryption
          + IPsec encryption on the underlying IP network
     * export laws restricting strong cryptography as a munition.
       See[2038] discussion below.
     * various attempts to convince people that fundamentally flawed
       cryptography, such as encryption with a[2039] back door for
       government access to data or with[2040] inadequate key lengths,
       was adequate for their needs.

   Of course governments are by no means the only threat to privacy and
   security on the net. Other threats include:
     * industrial espionage, as for example in this[2041] news story
     * attacks by organised criminals, as in this[2042] large-scale
       attack
     * collection of personal data by various companies.
          + for example, consider the various corporate winners of
            Privacy International's[2043] Big Brother Awards.
          + [2044]Zero Knowledge sell tools to defend against this
     * individuals may also be a threat in a variety of ways and for a
       variety of reasons
     * in particular, an individual with access to government or industry
       data collections could do considerable damage using that data in
       unauthorized ways.

   One[2045] study enumerates threats and possible responses for small
   and medium businesses. VPNs are a key part of the suggested strategy.

   We consider privacy a human right. See the UN's[2046] Universal
   Declaration of Human Rights, article twelve:

     No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his
     privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his
     honor and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of
     the law against such interference or attacks.

   Our objective is to help make privacy possible on the Internet using
   cryptography strong enough not even those well-funded government
   agencies are likely to break it. If we can do that, the chances of
   anyone else breaking it are negliible.

              Swan: Securing the Internet against Wiretapping

   My project for 1996 was to secure 5% of the Internet traffic against
   passive wiretapping. It didn't happen in 1996, so I'm still working on
   it in 1997, 1998, and 1999! If we get 5% in 1999 or 2000, we can
   secure 20% the next year, against both active and passive attacks; and
   80% the following year. Soon the whole Internet will be private and
   secure. The project is called S/WAN or S/Wan or Swan for Secure Wide
   Area Network; since it's free software, we call it FreeSwan to
   distinguish it from various commercial implementations.[2065] RSA came
   up with the term "S/WAN". Our main web site is at[2066]
   http://www.freeswan.org/. Want to help?

   The idea is to deploy PC-based boxes that will sit between your local
   area network and the Internet (near your firewall or router) which
   opportunistically encrypt your Internet packets. Whenever you talk to
   a machine (like a Web site) that doesn't support encryption, your
   traffic goes out "in the clear" as usual. Whenever you connect to a
   machine that does support this kind of encryption, this box
   automatically encrypts all your packets, and decrypts the ones that
   come in. In effect, each packet gets put into an "envelope" on one
   side of the net, and removed from the envelope when it reaches its
   destination. This works for all kinds of Internet traffic, including
   Web access, Telnet, FTP, email, IRC, Usenet, etc.

   The encryption boxes are standard PC's that use freely available Linux
   software that you can download over the Internet or install from a
   cheap CDROM.

   This wasn't just my idea; lots of people have been working on it for
   years. The encryption protocols for these boxes are called[2067] IPSEC
   (IP Security). They have been developed by the[2068] IP Security
   Working Group of the[2069] Internet Engineering Task Force, and will
   be a standard part of the next major version of the Internet protocols
   ([2070] IPv6). For today's (IP version 4) Internet, they are an
   option.

   The[2071] Internet Architecture Board and[2072] Internet Engineering
   Steering Group have taken a[2073] strong stand that the Internet
   should use powerful encryption to provide security and privacy. I
   think these protocols are the best chance to do that, because they can
   be deployed very easily, without changing your hardware or software or
   retraining your users. They offer the best security we know how to
   build, using the Triple-DES, RSA, and Diffie-Hellman algorithms.

   This "opportunistic encryption box" offers the "fax effect". As each
   person installs one for their own use, it becomes more valuable for
   their neighbors to install one too, because there's one more person to
   use it with. The software automatically notices each newly installed
   box, and doesn't require a network administrator to reconfigure it.
   Instead of "virtual private networks" we have a "REAL private
   network"; we add privacy to the real network instead of layering a
   manually-maintained virtual network on top of an insecure Internet.

    Deployment of IPSEC

   The US government would like to control the deployment of IP Security
   with its[2074] crypto export laws. This isn't a problem for my effort,
   because the cryptographic work is happening outside the United States.
   A foreign philanthropist, and others, have donated the resources
   required to add these protocols to the Linux operating system.[2075]
   Linux is a complete, freely available operating system for IBM PC's
   and several kinds of workstation, which is compatible with Unix. It
   was written by Linus Torvalds, and is still maintained by a talented
   team of expert programmers working all over the world and coordinating
   over the Internet. Linux is distributed under the[2076] GNU Public
   License, which gives everyone the right to copy it, improve it, give
   it to their friends, sell it commercially, or do just about anything
   else with it, without paying anyone for the privilege.

   Organizations that want to secure their network will be able to put
   two Ethernet cards into an IBM PC, install Linux on it from a $30
   CDROM or by downloading it over the net, and plug it in between their
   Ethernet and their Internet link or firewall. That's all they'll have
   to do to encrypt their Internet traffic everywhere outside their own
   local area network.

   Travelers will be able to run Linux on their laptops, to secure their
   connection back to their home network (and to everywhere else that
   they connect to, such as customer sites). Anyone who runs Linux on a
   standalone PC will also be able to secure their network connections,
   without changing their application software or how they operate their
   computer from day to day.

   There will also be numerous commercially available firewalls that use
   this technology.[2077] RSA Data Security is coordinating the[2078]
   S/Wan (Secure Wide Area Network) project among more than a dozen
   vendors who use these protocols. There's a[2079] compatability chart
   that shows which vendors have tested their boxes against which other
   vendors to guarantee interoperatility.

   Eventually it will also move into the operating systems and networking
   protocol stacks of major vendors. This will probably take longer,
   because those vendors will have to figure out what they want to do
   about the export controls.

    Current status

   My initial goal of securing 5% of the net by Christmas '96 was not
   met. It was an ambitious goal, and inspired me and others to work
   hard, but was ultimately too ambitious. The protocols were in an early
   stage of development, and needed a lot more protocol design before
   they could be implemented. As of April 1999, we have released version
   1.0 of the software ([2080] freeswan-1.0.tar.gz), which is suitable
   for setting up Virtual Private Networks using shared secrets for
   authentication. It does not yet do opportunistic encryption, or use
   DNSSEC for authentication; those features are coming in a future
   release.

   Protocols
          The low-level encrypted packet formats are defined. The system
          for publishing keys and providing secure domain name service is
          defined. The IP Security working group has settled on an
          NSA-sponsored protocol for key agreement (called
          ISAKMP/Oakley), but it is still being worked on, as the
          protocol and its documentation is too complex and incomplete.
          There are prototype implementations of ISAKMP. The protocol is
          not yet defined to enable opportunistic encryption or the use
          of DNSSEC keys.

   Linux Implementation
          The Linux implementation has reached its first major release
          and is ready for production use in manually-configured
          networks, using Linux kernel version 2.0.36.

   Domain Name System Security
          There is now a release of BIND 8.2 that includes most DNS
          Security features.

          The first prototype implementation of Domain Name System
          Security was funded by[2081] DARPA as part of their[2082]
          Information Survivability program.[2083] Trusted Information
          Systems wrote a modified version of[2084] BIND, the widely-used
          Berkeley implementation of the Domain Name System.

          TIS, ISC, and I merged the prototype into the standard version
          of BIND. The first production version that supports KEY and SIG
          records is bind-4.9.5. This or any later version of BIND will
          do for publishing keys. It is available from the[2085] Internet
          Software Consortium. This version of BIND is not
          export-controlled since it does not contain any cryptography.
          Later releases starting with BIND 8.2 include cryptography for
          authenticating DNS records, which is also exportable. Better
          documentation is needed.

    Why?

   Because I can. I have made enough money from several successful
   startup companies, that for a while I don't have to work to support
   myself. I spend my energies and money creating the kind of world that
   I'd like to live in and that I'd like my (future) kids to live in.
   Keeping and improving on the civil rights we have in the United
   States, as we move more of our lives into cyberspace, is a particular
   goal of mine.

    What You Can Do

   Install the latest BIND at your site.
          You won't be able to publish any keys for your domain, until
          you have upgraded your copy of BIND. The thing you really need
          from it is the new version of named, the Name Daemon, which
          knows about the new KEY and SIG record types. So, download it
          from the[2086] Internet Software Consortium and install it on
          your name server machine (or get your system administrator, or
          Internet Service Provider, to install it). Both your primary
          DNS site and all of your secondary DNS sites will need the new
          release before you will be able to publish your keys. You can
          tell which sites this is by running the Unix command "dig
          MYDOMAIN ns" and seeing which sites are mentioned in your NS
          (name server) records.

   Set up a Linux system and run a 2.0.x kernel on it
          Get a machine running Linux (say the 5.2 release from[2087] Red
          Hat). Give the machine two Ethernet cards.

   Install the Linux IPSEC (Freeswan) software
          If you're an experienced sysadmin or Linux hacker, install the
          freeswan-1.0 release, or any later release or snapshot. These
          releases do NOT provide automated "opportunistic" operation;
          they must be manually configured for each site you wish to
          encrypt with.

   Get on the linux-ipsec mailing list
          The discussion forum for people working on the project, and
          testing the code and documentation, is: linux-ipsec@clinet.fi.
          To join this mailing list, send email to[2088]
          linux-ipsec-REQUEST@clinet.fi containing a line of text that
          says "subscribe linux-ipsec". (You can later get off the
          mailing list the same way -- just send "unsubscribe
          linux-ipsec").

   Check back at this web page every once in a while
          I update this page periodically, and there may be new
          information in it that you haven't seen. My intent is to send
          email to the mailing list when I update the page in any
          significant way, so subscribing to the list is an alternative.

   Would you like to help? I can use people who are willing to write
   documentation, install early releases for testing, write cryptographic
   code outside the United States, sell pre-packaged software or systems
   including this technology, and teach classes for network
   administrators who want to install this technology. To offer to help,
   send me email at gnu@toad.com. Tell me what country you live in and
   what your citizenship is (it matters due to the export control laws;
   personally I don't care). Include a copy of your resume and the URL of
   your home page. Describe what you'd like to do for the project, and
   what you're uniquely qualified for. Mention what other volunteer
   projects you've been involved in (and how they worked out). Helping
   out will require that you be able to commit to doing particular
   things, meet your commitments, and be responsive by email. Volunteer
   projects just don't work without those things.

The goal of the project is to make it very hard to tap your wide area
communications.  The current system provides very good protection
against passive attacks (wiretapping and those big antenna farms).
Active attacks, which involve the intruder sending packets to your
system (like packets that break into sendmail and give them a root
shell :-) are much harder to guard against.  Active attacks that
involve sending people (breaking into your house and replacing parts
of your computer with ones that transmit what you're doing) are also
much harder to guard against.  Though we are putting effort into
protecting against active attacks, it's a much bigger job than merely
providing strong encryption.  It involves general computer security,
and general physical security, which are two very expensive problems
for even a site to solve, let alone to build into a whole society.

The societal benefit of building an infrastructure that protects
well against passive attacks is that it makes it much harder to do
undetected bulk monitoring of the population.  It's a defense against
police-states, not against policemen.

Policemen can put in the effort required to actively attack sites that
they have strong suspicions about.  But police states won't be able to
build systems that automatically monitor everyone's communications.
Either they will be able to monitor only a small subset of the
populace (by targeting those who screwed up their passive security),
or their monitoring activities will be detectable by those monitored
(active attacks leave packet traces or footprints), which can then be
addressed through the press and through political means if they become
too widespread.

FreeS/WAN does not protect very well against traffic analysis, which
is a kind of widespread police-state style monitoring that still
reveals significant information (who's talking to who) without
revealing the contents of what was said.  Defenses against traffic
analysis are an open research problem.  Zero Knowledge Systems is
actively deploying a system designed to thwart it, designed by Ian

Government promotion of weak crypto

   Various groups, especially governments and especially the US
   government, have a long history of advocating various forms of bogus
   security.

   We regard bogus security as extremely dangerous. If users are deceived
   into relying on bogus security, then they may be exposed to large
   risks. They would be better off having no security and knowing it. At
   least then they would be careful about what they said.

   Avoiding bogus security is a key design criterion for everything we do
   in FreeS/WAN. The most conspicuous example is our refusal to
   support[2094] single DES. Other IPsec "features" which we do not
   implement are discussed in our[2095] compatibility document.

  Escrowed encryption

   Various governments have made persistent attempts to encourage or
   mandate "escrowed encrytion", also called "key recovery", or GAK for
   "government access to keys". The idea is that cryptographic keys be
   held by some third party and turned over to law enforcement or
   security agencies under some conditions.
  Mary had a little key - she kept it in escrow,
  and every thing that Mary said,
  the feds were sure to know.

   A[2096] crypto quotes page attributes this to[2097] Sam Simpson.

   There is an excellent paper available on[2098] Risks of Escrowed
   Encryption, from a group of cryptographic luminaries which included
   our project leader.

   Like any unnecessary complication, GAK tends to weaken security of any
   design it infects. For example:
     * Matt Blaze found a fatal flaw in the US government's Clipper chip
       shortly after design information became public. See his paper
       "Protocol Failure in the Escrowed Encryption Standard" on
       his[2099] papers page.
     * a rather[2100] nasty bug was found in the "additional decryption
       keys" "feature" of some releases of[2101] PGP

   FreeS/WAN does not support escrowed encryption, and never will.

  Limited key lengths

   Various governments, and some vendors, have also made persistent
   attempts to convince people that:
     * weak systems are sufficient for some data
     * strong cryptography should be reserved for cases where the extra
       overheads are justified

   This is utter nonsense.

   Weak systems touted include:
     * the ludicrously weak (deliberately crippled) 40-bit ciphers that
       until recently were all various[2102] export laws allowed
     * 56-bit single DES, discussed[2103] below
     * 64-bit symmetric ciphers and 512-bit RSA, the maximums for
       unrestricted export under various current laws

   The notion that choice of ciphers or keysize should be determined by a
   trade-off between security requirements and overheads is pure
   bafflegab.
     * For most[2104] symmetric ciphers, it is simply a lie. Any block
       cipher has some natural maximum keysize inherent in the design --
       128 bits for[2105] IDEA or[2106] CAST-128, 256 for Serpent or
       Twofish, 448 for[2107] Blowfish and 2048 for[2108] RC4. Using a
       key size smaller than that limit gives exactly zero savings in
       overhead. The crippled 40-bit or 64-bit version of the cipher
       provides no advantage whatsoever.
     * [2109]AES uses 10 rounds with 128-bit keys, 12 rounds for 192-bit
       and 14 rounds for 256-bit, so there actually is a small difference
       in overhead, but not enough to matter in most applications.
     * For[2110] triple DES there is a grain of truth in the argument.
       3DES is indeed three times slower than single DES. However, the
       solution is not to use the insecure single DES, but to pick a
       faster secure cipher.[2111] CAST-128,[2112] Blowfish and the[2113]
       AES candidate ciphers are are all considerably faster in software
       than DES (let alone 3DES!), and apparently secure.
     * For[2114] public key techniques, there are extra overheads for
       larger keys, but they generally do not affect overall performance
       significantly. Practical public key applications are usually[2115]
       hybrid systems in which the bulk of the work is done by a
       symmetric cipher. The effect of increasing the cost of the public
       key operations is typically negligible because the public key
       operations use only a tiny fraction of total resources.
       For example, suppose public key operations use use 1% of the time
       in a hybrid system and you triple the cost of public key
       operations. The cost of symmetric cipher operations is unchanged
       at 99% of the original total cost, so the overall effect is a jump
       from 99 + 1 = 100 to 99 + 3 = 102, a 2% rise in system cost.

   In short, there has never been any technical reason to use inadequate
   ciphers. The only reason there has ever been for anyone to use such
   ciphers is that government agencies want weak ciphers used so that
   they can crack them. The alleged savings are simply propaganda.
   Mary had a little key (It's all she could export),
   and all the email that she sent was opened at the Fort.

   A[2116] crypto quotes page attributes this to[2117] Ron Rivest. NSA
   headquarters is at Fort Meade, Maryland.

   Our policy in FreeS/WAN is to use only cryptographic components with
   adequate keylength and no known weaknesses.
     * We do not implement single DES because it is clearly[2118]
       insecure, so implemeting it would violate our policy of avoiding
       bogus security. Our default cipher is[2119] 3DES
     * Similarly, we do not implement the 768-bit Group 1 for[2120]
       Diffie-Hellman key negotiation. We provide only the 1024-bit Group
       2 and 1536-bit Group 5.

   Detailed discussion of which IPsec features we implement or omit is in
   out[2121] compatibility document.

   These decisions imply that we cannot fully conform to the IPsec RFCs,
   since those have DES as the only required cipher and Group 1 as the
   only required DH group. (In our view, the standards were subverted
   into offerring bogus security.) Fortunately, we can still interoperate
   with most other IPsec implementations since nearly all implementers
   provide at least 3DES and Group 2 as well.

   We hope that eventually the RFCs will catch up with our (and others')
   current practice and reject dubious components. Some of our team and a
   number of others are working on this in[2122] IETF working groups.

    Some real trade-offs

   Of course, making systems secure does involve costs, and trade-offs
   can be made between cost and security. However, the real trade-offs
   have nothing to do with using weaker ciphers.

   There can be substantial hardware and software costs. There are often
   substantial training costs, both to train administrators and to
   increase user awareness of security issues and procedures. There are
   almost always substantial staff or contracting costs.

   Security takes staff time for planning, implementation, testing and
   auditing. Some of the issues are subtle; you need good (hence often
   expensive) people for this. You also need people to monitor your
   systems and respond to problems. The best safe ever built is insecure
   if an attacker can work on it for days without anyone noticing. Any
   computer is insecure if the administrator is "too busy" to check the
   logs.

   Moreover, someone in your organisation (or on contract to it) needs to
   spend considerable time keeping up with new developments. EvilDoers
   will know about new attacks shortly after they are found. You need to
   know about them before your systems are attacked. If your vendor
   provides a patch, you need to apply it. If the vendor does nothing,
   you need to complain or start looking for another vendor.

   For a fairly awful example, see this[2123] report. In that case over a
   million credit card numbers were taken from e-commerce sites, using
   security flaws in Windows NT servers. Microsoft had long since
   released patches for most or all of the flaws, but the site
   administrators had not applied them.

   At an absolute minimum, you must do something about such issues before
   an exploitation tool is posted to the net for downloading by dozens of
   "script kiddies". Such a tool might appear at any time from the
   announcement of the security hole to several months later. Once it
   appears, anyone with a browser and an attitude can break any system
   whose administrators have done nothing about the flaw.

   Compared to those costs, cipher overheads are an insignificant factor
   in the cost of security.

   The only thing using a weak cipher can do for you is to cause all your
   other investment to be wasted.

Cryptography Export Laws

   Many nations restrict the export of cryptography and some restrict its
   use by their citizens or others within their borders.

  US Law

   US laws, as currently interpreted by the US government, forbid export
   of most cryptographic software from the US in machine-readable form
   without government permission. In general, the restrictions apply even
   if the software is widely-disseminated or public-domain and even if it
   came from outside the US originally. Cryptography is legally a
   munition and export is tightly controlled under the[2124] EAR Export
   Administration Regulations.

   If you are a US citizen, your brain is considered US territory no
   matter where it is physically located at the moment. The US believes
   that its laws apply to its citizens everywhere, not just within the
   US. Providing technical assistance or advice to foreign "munitions"
   projects is illegal. The US government has very little sense of humor
   about this issue and does not consider good intentions to be
   sufficient excuse. Beware.

   The[2125] official website for these regulations is run by the
   Commerce Department's Bureau of Export Administration (BXA).

   The[2126] Bernstein case challenges the export restrictions on
   Constitutional grounds. Code is speech so restrictions on export of
   code violate the First Amendment's free speech provisions. This
   argument has succeeded in two levels of court so far. It is quite
   likely to go on to the Supreme Court.

   The regulations were changed substantially in January 2000, apparently
   as a government attempt to get off the hook in the Bernstein case. It
   is now legal to export public domain source code for encryption,
   provided you notify the[2127] BXA.

   There are, however, still restrictions in force. Moreover, the
   regulations can still be changed again whenever the government chooses
   to do so. Short of a Supreme Court ruling (in the Berstein case or
   another) that overturns the regulations completely, the problem of
   export regulation is not likely to go away in the forseeable future.

    US contributions to FreeS/WAN

   The FreeS/WAN project cannot accept software contributions, not even
   small bug fixes, from US citizens or residents. We want it to be
   absolutely clear that our distribution is not subject to US export
   law. Any contribution from an American might open that question to a
   debate we'd prefer to avoid. It might also put the contributor at
   serious legal risk.

   Of course Americans can still make valuable contributions (many
   already have) by reporting bugs, or otherwise contributing to
   discussions, on the project[2128] mailing list. Since the list is
   public, this is clearly constitutionally protected free speech.

   Note, however, that the export laws restrict Americans from providing
   technical assistance to foreign "munitions" projects. The government
   might claim that private discussions or correspondence with FreeS/WAN
   developers were covered by this. It is not clear what the courts would
   do with such a claim, so we strongly encourage Americans to use the
   list rather than risk the complications.

  What's wrong with restrictions on cryptography

   Some quotes from prominent cryptography experts:

     The real aim of current policy is to ensure the continued
     effectiveness of US information warfare assets against individuals,
     businesses and governments in Europe and elsewhere.
     [2129]Ross Anderson, Cambridge University

     If the government were honest about its motives, then the debate
     about crypto export policy would have ended years ago.
     [2130]Bruce Schneier, Counterpane Systems

     The NSA regularly lies to people who ask it for advice on export
     control. They have no reason not to; accomplishing their goal by
     any legal means is fine by them. Lying by government employees is
     legal.
     John Gilmore.

   The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) and the Internet Engineering
   Steering Group (IESG) made a[2131] strong statement in favour of
   worldwide access to strong cryptography. Essentially the same
   statement is in the appropriately numbered[2132] RFC 1984. Two
   critical paragraphs are:

     ... various governments have actual or proposed policies on access
     to cryptographic technology ...

     (a) ... export controls ...
     (b) ... short cryptographic keys ...
     (c) ... keys should be in the hands of the government or ...
     (d) prohibit the use of cryptology ...

     We believe that such policies are against the interests of
     consumers and the business community, are largely irrelevant to
     issues of military security, and provide only a marginal or
     illusory benefit to law enforcement agencies, ...

     The IAB and IESG would like to encourage policies that allow ready
     access to uniform strong cryptographic technology for all Internet
     users in all countries.

   Our goal in the FreeS/WAN project is to build just such "strong
   cryptographic technology" and to distribute it "for all Internet users
   in all countries".

   More recently, the same two bodies (IESG and IAB) have issued[2133]
   RFC 2804 on why the IETF should not build wiretapping capabilities
   into protocols for the convenience of security or law enforcement
   agenicies. The abstract from that document is:

     The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) has been asked to take a
     position on the inclusion into IETF standards-track documents of
     functionality designed to facilitate wiretapping.

     This memo explains what the IETF thinks the question means, why its
     answer is "no", and what that answer means.

   A quote from the debate leading up to that RFC:

     We should not be building surveillance technology into standards.
     Law enforcement was not supposed to be easy. Where it is easy, it's
     called a police state.
     Jeff Schiller of MIT, in a discussion of FBI demands for wiretap
     capability on the net, as quoted by[2134] Wired.

   The[2135] Raven mailing list was set up for this IETF discussion.

   Our goal is to go beyond that RFC and prevent Internet wiretapping
   entirely.

  The Wassenaar Arrangement

   Restrictions on the export of cryptography are not just US policy,
   though some consider the US at least partly to blame for the policies
   of other nations in this area.

   A number of countries:

   Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Czech
   Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland,
   Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland,
   Portugal, Republic of Korea, Romania, Russian Federation, Slovak
   Republic, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine, United Kingdom
   and United States

   have signed the Wassenaar Arrangement which restricts export of
   munitions and other tools of war. Cryptographic sofware is covered
   there.

   Wassenaar details are available from the[2136] Wassenaar Secretariat,
   and elsewhere in a more readable[2137] HTML version.

   For a critique see the[2138] GILC site:

     The Global Internet Liberty Campaign (GILC) has begun a campaign
     calling for the removal of cryptography controls from the Wassenaar
     Arrangement.

     The aim of the Wassenaar Arrangement is to prevent the build up of
     military capabilities that threaten regional and international
     security and stability . . .

     There is no sound basis within the Wassenaar Arrangement for the
     continuation of any export controls on cryptographic products.

   We agree entirely.

   An interesting analysis of Wassenaar can be found on the[2139]
   cyber-rights.org site.

  Export status of Linux FreeS/WAN

   We believe our software is entirely exempt from these controls since
   the Wassenaar[2140] General Software Note says:

     The Lists do not control "software" which is either:
    1. Generally available to the public by . . . retail . . . or
    2. "In the public domain".

   There is a note restricting some of this, but it is a sub-heading
   under point 1, so it appears not to apply to public domain software.

   Their glossary defines "In the public domain" as:

     . . . "technology" or "software" which has been made available
     without restrictions upon its further dissemination.

     N.B. Copyright restrictions do not remove "technology" or
     "software" from being "in the public domain".

   We therefore believe that software freely distributed under the[2141]
   GNU Public License, such as Linux FreeS/WAN, is exempt from Wassenaar
   restrictions.

   Most of the development work is being done in Canada. Our
   understanding is that the Canadian government accepts this
   interpretation.
     * A web statement of[2142] Canadian policy is available from the
       Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade.
     * Another document from that department states that[2143] public
       domain software is exempt from the export controls.
     * A researcher's[2144] analysis of Canadian policy is also
       available.

   Recent copies of the freely modifiable and distributable source code
   exist in many countries. Citizens all over the world participate in
   its use and evolution, and guard its ongoing distribution. Even if
   Canadian policy were to change, the software would continue to evolve
   in countries which do not restrict exports, and would continue to be
   imported from there into unfree countries. "The Net culture treats
   censorship as damage, and routes around it."

  Help spread IPsec around

   You can help. If you don't know of a Linux FreeS/WAN archive in your
   own country, please download it now to your personal machine, and
   consider making it publicly accessible if that doesn't violate your
   own laws. If you have the resources, consider going one step further
   and setting up a mirror site for the whole[2145] munitions Linux
   crypto software archive.

   If you make Linux CD-ROMs, please consider including this code, in a
   way that violates no laws (in a free country, or in a domestic-only CD
   product).

   Please send a note about any new archive mirror sites or CD
   distributions to linux-ipsec@clinet.fi so we can update the
   documentation.

   Lists of current[2146] mirror sites and of[2147] distributions which
   include FreeS/WAN are in our introduction section.

DES is Not Secure

   DES, the Data Encryption S tandard, can no longer be considered
   secure. While no major flaws in its innards are known, it is
   fundamentally inadequate because its 56-bit key is too short. It is
   vulnerable to[2148] brute-force search of the whole key space, either
   by large collections of general-purpose machines or even more quickly
   by specialized hardware. Of course this also applies to any other
   cipher with only a 56-bit key. The only reason anyone could have for
   using a 56 or 64-bit key is to comply with various[2149] export laws
   intended to ensure the use of breakable ciphers.

   Non-government cryptologists have been saying DES's 56-bit key was too
   short for some time -- some of them were saying it in the 70's when
   DES became a standard -- but the US government has consistently
   ridiculed such suggestions.

   A group of well-known cryptographers looked at key lengths in a[2150]
   1996 paper. They suggested a minimum of 75 bits to consider an
   existing cipher secure and a minimum of 90 bits for new ciphers. More
   recent papers, covering both[2151] symmetric and[2152] public key
   systems are at[2153] cryptosavvy.com and[2154] rsa.com. For all
   algorithms, the minimum keylengths recommended in such papers are
   significantly longer than the maximums allowed by various export laws.

   In a[2155] 1998 ruling, a German court described DES as "out-of-date
   and not safe enough" and held a bank liable for using it.

  Dedicated hardware breaks DES in a few days

   The question of DES security has now been settled once and for all. In
   early 1998, the[2156] Electronic Frontier Foundation built a[2157]
   DES-cracking machine. It can find a DES key in an average of a few
   days' search. The details of all this, including complete code
   listings and complete plans for the machine, have been published
   in[2158] Cracking DES, by the Electronic Frontier Foundation.

   That machine cost just over $200,000 to design and build. "Moore's
   Law" is that machines get faster (or cheaper, for the same speed) by
   roughly a factor of two every 18 months. At that rate, their $200,000
   in 1998 becomes $50,000 in 2001.

   However, Moore's Law is not exact and the $50,000 estimate does not
   allow for the fact that a copy based on the published EFF design would
   cost far less than the original. We cannot say exactly what such a
   cracker would cost today, but it would likely be somewhere between
   $10,000 and $100,000.

   A large corporation could build one of these out of petty cash. The
   cost is low enough for a senior manager to hide it in a departmental
   budget and avoid having to announce or justify the project. Any
   government agency, from a major municipal police force up, could
   afford one. Or any other group with a respectable budget -- criminal
   organisations, political groups, labour unions, religious groups, ...
   Or any millionaire with an obsession or a grudge, or just strange
   taste in toys.

   One might wonder if a private security or detective agency would have
   one for rent. They wouldn't need many clients to pay off that
   investment.

  Spooks may break DES faster yet

   As for the security and intelligence agencies of various nations, they
   may have had DES crackers for years, and theirs may be much faster. It
   is difficult to make most computer applications work well on parallel
   machines, or to design specialised hardware to accelerate them.
   Cipher-cracking is one of the very few exceptions. It is entirely
   straightforward to speed up cracking by just adding hardware. Within
   very broad limits, you can make it as fast as you like if you have the
   budget. The EFF's $200,000 machine breaks DES in a few days. An[2159]
   aviation website gives the cost of a B1 bomber as $200,000,000.
   Spending that much, an intelligence agency could break DES in an
   average time of six and a half minutes.

   That estimate assumes they use the EFF's 1998 technology and just
   spend more money. They may have an attack that is superior to brute
   force, they quite likely have better chip technology (Moore's law, a
   bigger budget, and whatever secret advances they may have made) and of
   course they may have spent the price of an aircraft carrier, not just
   one aircraft.

   In short, we have no idea how quickly these organisations can break
   DES. Unless they're spectacularly incompetent or horribly underfunded,
   they can certainly break it, but we cannot guess how quickly. Pick any
   time unit between days and milliseconds; none is entirely
   unbelievable. More to the point, none of them is of any comfort if you
   don't want such organisations reading your communications.

   Note that this may be a concern even if nothing you do is a threat to
   anyone's national security. An intelligence agency might well consider
   it to be in their national interest for certain companies to do well.
   If you're competing against such companies in a world market and that
   agency can read your secrets, you have a serious problem.

   One might wonder about technology the former Soviet Union and its
   allies developed for cracking DES during the Cold War. They must have
   tried; the cipher was an American standard and widely used. Certainly
   those countries have some fine mathematicians, and those agencies had
   budget. How well did they succeed? Is their technology now for sale or
   rent?

  Networks break DES in a few weeks

   Before the definitive EFF effort, DES had been cracked several times
   by people using many machines. See this[2160] press release for
   example.

   A major corporation, university, or government department could break
   DES by using spare cycles on their existing collection of computers,
   by dedicating a group of otherwise surplus machines to the problem, or
   by combining the two approaches. It might take them weeks or months,
   rather than the days required for the EFF machine, but they could do
   it.

   What about someone working alone, without the resources of a large
   organisation? For them, cracking DES will not be easy, but it may be
   possible. A few thousand dollars buys a lot of surplus workstations. A
   pile of such machines will certainly heat your garage nicely and might
   break DES in a few months or years. Or enroll at a university and use
   their machines. Or use an employer's machines. Or crack security
   somewhere and steal the resources to crack a DES key. Or write a virus
   that steals small amounts of resources on many machines. Or . . .

   None of these approaches are easy or break DES really quickly, but an
   attacker only needs to find one that is feasible and breaks DES
   quickly enough to be dangerous. How much would you care to bet that
   this will be impossible if the attacker is clever and determined? How
   valuable is your data? Are you authorised to risk it on a dubious bet?

  We disable DES

   In short, it is now absolutely clear that DES is not secure against
     * any well-funded opponent
     * any opponent (even a penniless one) with access (even stolen
       access) to enough general purpose computers

   That is why Linux FreeS/WAN disables all transforms which use plain
   DES for encryption.

   DES is in the source code, because we need DES to implement our
   default encryption transform,[2161] Triple DES. We urge you not to use
   single DES. We do not provide any easy way to enable it in FreeS/WAN,
   and our policy is to provide no assistance to anyone wanting to do so.

  40-bits is laughably weak

   The same is true, in spades, of ciphers -- DES or others -- crippled
   by 40-bit keys, as many ciphers were required to be until recently
   under various[2162] export laws. A brute force search of such a
   cipher's keyspace is 2^16 times faster than a similar search against
   DES. The EFF's machine can do a brute-force search of a 40-bit key
   space in seconds. One contest to crack a 40-bit cipher was won by a
   student[2163] using a few hundred idle machines at his university. It
   took only three and half hours.

   We do not, and will not, implement any 40-bit cipher.

  Triple DES is almost certainly secure

   [2164]Triple DES, usually abbreviated 3DES, applies DES three times,
   with three different keys. DES seems to be basically an excellent
   cipher design; it has withstood several decades of intensive analysis
   without any disastrous flaws being found. It's only major flaw is that
   the small keyspace allows brute force attacks to succeeed. Triple DES
   enlarges the key space to 168 bits, making brute-force search a
   ridiculous impossibility.

   3DES is currently the only block cipher implemented in FreeS/WAN. 3DES
   is, unfortunately, about 1/3 the speed of DES, but modern CPUs still
   do it at quite respectable speeds. Some[2165] speed measurements for
   our code are available.

  AES in IPsec

   The[2166] AES project has chosen a replacement for DES, a new standard
   cipher for use in non-classified US government work and in regulated
   industries such as banking. This cipher will almost certainly become
   widely used for many applications, including IPsec.

   The winner, announced in October 2000 after several years of analysis
   and discussion, was the[2167] Rijndael cipher from two Belgian
   designers.

   It is almost certain that FreeS/WAN will add AES support.[2168] AES
   patches are already available.

  Press release for version 1.0

        Strong Internet Privacy Software Free for Linux Users Worldwide

Toronto, ON, April 14, 1999 -

The Linux FreeS/WAN project today released free software to protect
the privacy of Internet communications using strong encryption codes.
FreeS/WAN automatically encrypts data as it crosses the Internet, to
prevent unauthorized people from receiving or modifying it.  One
ordinary PC per site runs this free software under Linux to become a
secure gateway in a Virtual Private Network, without having to modify
users' operating systems or application software.  The project built
and released the software outside the United States, avoiding US
government regulations which prohibit good privacy protection.
FreeS/WAN version 1.0 is available immediately for downloading at
http://www.xs4all.nl/~freeswan/.

"Today's FreeS/WAN release allows network administrators to build
excellent secure gateways out of old PCs at no cost, or using a cheap
new PC," said John Gilmore, the entrepreneur who instigated the
project in 1996.  "They can build operational experience with strong
network encryption and protect their users' most important
communications worldwide."

"The software was written outside the United States, and we do not
accept contributions from US citizens or residents, so that it can be
freely published for use in every country," said Henry Spencer, who
built the release in Toronto, Canada.  "Similar products based in the
US require hard-to-get government export licenses before they can be
provided to non-US users, and can never be simply published on a Web
site.  Our product is freely available worldwide for immediate
downloading, at no cost."

FreeS/WAN provides privacy against both quiet eavesdropping (such as
"packet sniffing") and active attempts to compromise communications
(such as impersonating participating computers).  Secure "tunnels" carry
information safely across the Internet between locations such as a
company's main office, distant sales offices, and roaming laptops.  This
protects the privacy and integrity of all information sent among those
locations, including sensitive intra-company email, financial transactions
such as mergers and acquisitions, business negotiations, personal medical
records, privileged correspondence with lawyers, and information about
crimes or civil rights violations.  The software will be particularly
useful to frequent wiretapping targets such as private companies competing
with government-owned companies, civil rights groups and lawyers,
opposition political parties, and dissidents.

FreeS/WAN provides privacy for Internet packets using the proposed
standard Internet Protocol Security (IPSEC) protocols.  FreeS/WAN
negotiates strong keys using Diffie-Hellman key agreement with 1024-bit
keys, and encrypts each packet with 168-bit Triple-DES (3DES).  A modern
$500 PC can set up a tunnel in less than a second, and can encrypt
6 megabits of packets per second, easily handling the whole available
bandwidth at the vast majority of Internet sites.  In preliminary testing,
FreeS/WAN interoperated with 3DES IPSEC products from OpenBSD, PGP, SSH,
Cisco, Raptor, and Xedia.  Since FreeS/WAN is distributed as source code,
its innards are open to review by outside experts and sophisticated users,
reducing the chance of undetected bugs or hidden security compromises.

The software has been in development for several years.  It has been
funded by several philanthropists interested in increased privacy on
the Internet, including John Gilmore, co-founder of the Electronic
Frontier Foundation, a leading online civil rights group.

                              The IPsec protocols

   This section provides information on the IPsec protocols which
   FreeS/WAN implements. For more detail, see the[2175] RFCs .

   The basic idea of IPsec is to provide security functions,[2176]
   authentication and[2177] encryption, at the IP (Internet Protocol)
   level. This requires a higher-level protocol (IKE) to set things up
   for the IP-level services (ESP and AH).

Protocols and phases

   Three protocols are used in an IPsec implementation:

   ESP, Encapsulating Security Payload
          Encrypts and/or authenticates data

   AH, Authentication Header
          Provides a packet authentication service

   IKE, Internet Key Exchange
          Negotiates connection parameters, including keys, for the other
          two

   The term "IPsec" (also written as IPSEC) is slightly ambiguous. In
   some contexts, it includes all three of the above but in other
   contexts it refers only to AH and ESP.

   There is more detail below, but a quick summary of how the whole thing
   works is:

   Phase one IKE (main mode exchange)
          sets up a keying channel (ISAKMP SA) between the two gateways

   Phase two IKE (quick mode exchange)
          sets up data channels (IPsec SAs)

   IPsec proper
          exchanges data using AH or ESP

   Both phases of IKE are repeated periodically to automate re-keying.

Applying IPsec

   Authentication and encryption functions for network data can, of
   course, be provided at other levels. Many security protocols work at
   levels above IP.
     * [2178]PGP encrypts and authenticates mail messages
     * [2179]SSH authenticates remote logins and then encrypts the
       session
     * [2180]SSL or[2181] TLS provides security at the sockets layer,
       e.g. for secure web browsing

   and so on. Other techniques work at levels below IP. For example, data
   on a communications circuit or an entire network can be encrypted by
   specialised hardware. This is common practice in high-security
   applications.

  Advantages of IPsec

   There are, however, advantages to doing it at the IP level instead of,
   or as well as, at other levels.

   IPsec is the most general way to provide these services for the
   Internet.
     * Higher-level services protect a single protocol; for example PGP
       protects mail.
     * Lower level services protect a single medium; for example a pair
       of encryption boxes on the ends of a line make wiretaps on that
       line useless unless the attacker is capable of breaking the
       encryption.

   IPsec, however, can protect any protocol running above IP and any
   medium which IP runs over. More to the point, it can protect a mixture
   of application protocols running over a complex combination of media.
   This is the normal situation for Internet communication; IPsec is the
   only general solution.

   IPsec can also provide some security services "in the background",
   with no visible impact on users. To use[2182] PGP encryption and
   signatures on mail, for example, the user must at least:
     * remember his or her passphrase,
     * keep it secure
     * follow procedures to validate correspondents' keys

   These systems can be designed so that the burden on users is not
   onerous, but any system will place some requirements on users. No such
   system can hope to be secure if users are sloppy about meeting those
   requirements. The author has seen username and password stuck on
   terminals with post-it notes in an allegedly secure environment, for
   example.

  Limitations of IPsec

   IPsec is designed to secure IP links between machines. It does that
   well, but it is important to remember that there are many things it
   does not do. Some of the important limitations are:

   IPsec cannot be secure if your system isn't
          System security on IPsec gateway machines is an essential
          requirement if IPsec is to function as designed. No system can
          be trusted if the underlying machine has been subverted. See
          books on Unix security such as[2183] Garfinkel and Spafford or
          our web references for[2184] Linux security or more
          general[2185] computer security.

          Of course, there is another side to this. IPsec can be a
          powerful tool for improving system and network security. For
          example, requiring packet authentication makes various spoofing
          attacks harder and IPsec tunnels can be extremely useful for
          secure remote administration of various things.

   IPsec is not end-to-end
          IPsec cannot provide the same end-to-end security as systems
          working at higher levels. IPsec encrypts an IP connection
          between two machines, which is quite a different thing than
          encrypting messages between users or between applications.

          For example, if you need mail encrypted from the sender's
          desktop to the recipient's desktop and decryptable only by the
          recipient, use[2186] PGP or another such system. IPsec can
          encrypt any or all of the links involved -- between the two
          mail servers, or between either server and its clients. It
          could even be used to secure a direct IP link from the sender's
          desktop machine to the recipient's, cutting out any sort of
          network snoop. What it cannot ensure is end-to-end user-to-user
          security. If only IPsec is used to secure mail, then anyone
          with appropriate privileges on any machine where that mail is
          stored (at either end or on any store-and-forward servers in
          the path) can read it.

          In another common setup, IPsec encrypts packets at a security
          gateway machine as they leave the sender's site and decrypts
          them on arrival at the gateway to the recipient's site. This
          does provide a useful security service -- only encrypted data
          is passed over the Internet -- but it does not even come close
          to providing an end-to-end service. In particular, anyone with
          appropriate privileges on either site's LAN can intercept the
          message in unencrypted form.

   IPsec cannot do everything
          IPsec also cannot provide all the functions of systems working
          at higher levels of the protocol stack. If you need a document
          electronically signed by a particular person, then you need his
          or her[2187] digital signature and a[2188] public key
          cryptosystem to verify it with.

          Note, however, that IPsec authentication of the underlying
          communication can make various attacks on higher-level
          protocols more difficult. In particular, authentication
          prevents[2189] man-in-the-middle attacks.

   IPsec authenticates machines, not users
          IPsec uses strong authentication mechanisms to control which
          messages go to which machines, but it does not have the concept
          of user ID, which is vital to many other security mechansims
          and policies. This means some care must be taken in fitting the
          various security mechansims on a network together. For example,
          if you need to control which users access your database server,
          you need some non-IPsec mechansim for that. IPsec can control
          which machines connect to the server, and can ensure that data
          transfer to those machines is done securely, but that is all.
          Either the machines themselves must control user access or
          there must be some form of user authentication to the database,
          independent of IPsec.

   IPsec does not stop denial of service attacks
          [2190]Denial of service attacks aim at causing a system to
          crash, overload, or become confused so that legitimate users
          cannot get whatever services the system is supposed to provide.
          These are quite different from attacks in which the attacker
          seeks either to use the service himself or to subvert the
          service into delivering incorrect results.

          IPsec shifts the ground for DoS attacks; the attacks possible
          against systems using IPsec are different than those that might
          be used against other systems. It does not, however, eliminate
          the possibility of such attacks.

   IPsec does not stop traffic analysis
          [2191]Traffic analysis is the attempt to derive intelligence
          from messages without regard for their contents. In the case of
          IPsec, it would mean analysis based on things visible in the
          unencrypted headers of encrypted packets -- source and
          destination gateway addresses, packet size, et cetera. Given
          the resources to acquire such data and some skill in analysing
          it (both of which any national intelligence agency should
          have), this can be a very powerful technique.

          IPsec is not designed to defend against this. Partial defenses
          are certainly possible, and some are[2192] described below, but
          it is not clear that any complete defense can be provided.

  IPsec is a general mechanism for securing IP

   While IPsec does not provide all functions of a mail encryption
   package, it can encrypt your mail. In particular, it can ensure that
   all mail passing between a pair or a group of sites is encrypted. An
   attacker looking only at external traffic, without access to anything
   on or behind the IPsec gateway, cannot read your mail. He or she is
   stymied by IPsec just as he or she would be by[2193] PGP.

   The advantage is that IPsec can provide the same protection for
   anything transmitted over IP. In a corporate network example, PGP lets
   the branch offices exchange secure mail with head office. SSL and SSH
   allow them to securely view web pages, connect as terminals to
   machines, and so on. IPsec can support all those applications, plus
   database queries, file sharing (NFS or Windows), other protocols
   encapsulated in IP (Netware, Appletalk, ...), phone-over-IP,
   video-over-IP, ... anything-over-IP. The only limitation is that IP
   Multicast is not yet supported, though there are Internet Draft
   documents for that.

   IPsec creates secure tunnels through untrusted networks . Sites
   connected by these tunnels form VPNs,[2194] Virtual Private Networks.

   IPsec gateways can be installed wherever they are required.
     * One organisation might choose to install IPsec only on firewalls
       between their LANs and the Internet. This would allow them to
       create a VPN linking several offices. It would provide protection
       against anyone outside their sites.
     * Another might install IPsec on departmental servers so everything
       on the corporate backbone net was encrypted. This would protect
       messages on that net from everyone except the sending and
       receiving department.
     * Another might be less concerned with information secrecy and more
       with controlling access to certain resources. They might use IPsec
       packet authentication as part of an access control mechanism, with
       or without also using the IPsec encryption service.
     * It is even possible (assuming adequate processing power and an
       IPsec implementation in each node) to make every machine its own
       IPsec gateway so that everything on a LAN is encrypted. This
       protects information from everyone outside the sending and
       receiving machine.
     * These techniques can be combined in various ways. One might, for
       example, require authentication everywhere on a network while
       using encryption only for a few links.

   Which of these, or of the many other possible variants, to use is up
   to you. IPsec provides mechanisms; you provide the policy .

   No end user action is required for IPsec security to be used; they
   don't even have to know about it. The site administrators, of course,
   do have to know about it and to put some effort into making it work.
   Poor administration can compromise IPsec as badly as the post-it notes
   mentioned above. It seems reasonable, though, for organisations to
   hope their system administrators are generally both more
   security-conscious than end users and more able to follow computer
   security procedures. If not, at least there are fewer of them to
   educate or replace.

   IPsec can be, and often should be, used with along with security
   protocols at other levels. If two sites communicate with each other
   via the Internet, then IPsec is the obvious way to protect that
   communication. If two others have a direct link between them, either
   link encryption or IPsec would make sense. Choose one or use both.
   Whatever you use at and below the IP level, use other things as
   required above that level. Whatever you use above the IP level,
   consider what can be done with IPsec to make attacks on the higher
   levels harder. For example,[2195] man-in-the-middle attacks on various
   protocols become difficult if authentication at packet level is in use
   on the potential victims' communication channel.

  Using authentication without encryption

   Where appropriate, IPsec can provide authentication without
   encryption. One might do this, for example:
     * where the data is public but one wants to be sure of getting the
       right data, for example on some web sites
     * where encryption is judged unnecessary, for example on some
       company or department LANs
     * where strong encryption is provided at link level, below IP
     * where strong encryption is provided in other protocols, above IP
       Note that IPsec authentication may make some attacks on those
       protocols harder.

   Authentication has lower overheads than encryption.

   The protocols provide four ways to build such connections, using
   either an AH-only connection or ESP using null encryption, and in
   either manually or automatically keyed mode. FreeS/WAN supports only
   one of these, manually keyed AH-only connections, and we do not
   recommend using that. Our reasons are discussed under[2196] Resisting
   traffic analysis a few sections further along.

  Encryption without authentication is dangerous

   Originally, the IPsec encryption protocol[2197] ESP didn't do
   integrity checking. It only did encryption. Steve Bellovin found many
   ways to attack ESP used without authentication. See his paper[2198]
   Problem areas for the IP Security Protocols. To make a secure
   connection, you had to add an[2199] AH Authentication Header as well
   as ESP. Rather than incur the overhead of several layers (and rather
   than provide an ESP layer that didn't actually protect the traffic),
   the IPsec working group built integrity and replay checking directly
   into ESP.

   Today, typical usage is one of:
     * ESP for encryption and authentication
     * AH for authentication alone

   Other variants are allowed by the standard, but not much used:

   ESP encryption without authentication
          Bellovin has demonstrated fatal flaws in this. Do not use.

   ESP encryption with AH authentication
          This has higher overheads than using the authentication in ESP,
          and no obvious benefit in most cases. The exception might be a
          network where AH authentication was widely or universally used.
          If you're going to do AH to conform with network policy, why
          authenticate again in the ESP layer?

   Authenticate twice, with AH and with ESP
          Why? Of course, some folk consider "belt and suspenders" the
          sensible approach to security. If you're among them, you might
          use both protocols here. You might also use both to satisfy
          different parts of a security policy. For example, an
          organisation might require AH authentication everywhere but two
          users within the organisation might use ESP as well.

   ESP authentication without encryption
          The standard allows this, calling it "null encryption".
          FreeS/WAN does not support it. We recommend that you use AH
          instead if authentication is all you require. AH authenticates
          parts of the IP header, which ESP-null does not do.

   Some of these variants cannot be used with FreeS/WAN because we do not
   support ESP-null and do not support automatic keying of AH-only
   connections.

   There are fairly frequent suggestions that AH be dropped entirely from
   the IPsec specifications since ESP and null encryption can handle that
   situation. It is not clear whether this will occur. My guess is that
   it is unlikely.

  Multiple layers of IPsec processing are possible

   The above describes combinations possible on a single IPsec
   connection. In a complex network you may have several layers of IPsec
   in play, with any of the above combinations at each layer.

   For example, a connection from a desktop machine to a database server
   might require AH authentication. Working with other host, network and
   database security measures, AH might be just the thing for access
   control. You might decide not to use ESP encryption on such packets,
   since it uses resources and might complicate network debugging. Within
   the site where the server is, then, only AH would be used on those
   packets.

   Users at another office, however, might have their whole connection
   (AH headers and all) passing over an IPsec tunnel connecting their
   office to the one with the database server. Such a tunnel should use
   ESP encryption and authentication. You need authentication in this
   layer because without authentication the encryption is vulnerable and
   the gateway cannot verify the AH authentication. The AH is between
   client and database server; the gateways aren't party to it.

   In this situation, some packets would get multiple layers of IPsec
   applied to them, AH on an end-to-end client-to-server basis and ESP
   from one office's security gateway to the other.

  Resisting traffic analysis

   [2200]Traffic analysis is the attempt to derive useful intelligence
   from encrypted traffic without breaking the encryption.

   Is your CEO exchanging email with a venture capital firm? With
   bankruptcy trustees? With an executive recruiting agency? With the
   holder of some important patents? If an eavesdropper learns about any
   of those, then he has interesting intelligence on your company,
   whether or not he can read the messages themselves.

   Even just knowing that there is network traffic between two sites may
   tell an analyst something useful, especially when combined with
   whatever other information he or she may have. For example, if you
   know Company A is having cashflow problems and Company B is looking
   for aquisitions, then knowing that packets are passing between the two
   is interesting. It is more interesting if you can tell it is email,
   and perhaps yet more if you know the sender and recipient.

   Except in the simplest cases, traffic analysis is hard to do well. It
   requires both considerable resources and considerable analytic skill.
   However, intelligence agencies of various nations have been doing it
   for centuries and many of them are likely quite good at it by now.
   Various commercial organisations, especially those working on
   "targeted marketing" may also be quite good at analysing certain types
   of traffic.

   In general, defending against traffic analysis is also difficult.
   Inventing a really good defense could get you a PhD and some
   interesting job offers.

   IPsec is not designed to stop traffic analysis and we know of no
   plausible method of extending it to do so. That said, there are ways
   to make traffic analysis harder. This section describes them.

    Using "unnecessary" encryption

   One might choose to use encryption even where it appears unnecessary
   in order to make analysis more difficult. Consider two offices which
   pass a small volume of business data between them using IPsec and also
   transfer large volumes of Usenet news. At first glance, it would seem
   silly to encrypt the newsfeed, except possibly for any newsgroups that
   are internal to the company. Why encrypt data that is all publicly
   available from many sites?

   However, if we encrypt a lot of news and send it down the same
   connection as our business data, we make[2201] traffic analysis much
   harder. A snoop cannot now make inferences based on patterns in the
   volume, direction, sizes, sender, destination, or timing of our
   business messages. Those messages are hidden in a mass of news
   messages encapsulated in the same way.

   If we're going to do this we need to ensure that keys change often
   enough to remain secure even with high volumes and with the adversary
   able to get plaintext of much of the data. We also need to look at
   other attacks this might open up. For example, can the adversary use a
   chosen plaintext attack, deliberately posting news articles which,
   when we receive and encrypt them, will help break our encryption? Or
   can he block our business data transmission by flooding us with silly
   news articles? Or ...

   Also, note that this does not provide complete protection against
   traffic analysis. A clever adversary might still deduce useful
   intelligence from statistical analysis (perhaps comparing the input
   newsfeed to encrypted output, or comparing the streams we send to
   different branch offices), or by looking for small packets which might
   indicate establishment of TCP connections, or ...

   As a general rule, though, to improve resistance to traffic analysis,
   you should encrypt as much traffic as possible, not just as much as
   seems necessary.

    Using multiple encryption

   This also applies to using multiple layers of encryption. If you have
   an IPsec tunnel between two branch offices, it might appear silly to
   send[2202] PGP-encrypted email through that tunnel. However, if you
   suspect someone is snooping your traffic, then it does make sense:
     * it protects the mail headers; they cannot even see who is mailing
       who
     * it protects against user bungles or software malfunctions that
       accidentally send messages in the clear
     * it makes any attack on the mail encryption much harder; they have
       to break IPsec or break into your network before they can start on
       the mail encryption

   Similar arguments apply for[2203] SSL-encrypted web traffic or[2204]
   SSH-encrypted remote login sessions, even for end-to-end IPsec tunnels
   between systems in the two offices.

    Using fewer tunnels

   It may also help to use fewer tunnels. For example, if all you
   actually need encrypted is connections between:
     * mail servers at branch and head offices
     * a few branch office users and the head office database server

   You might build one tunnel per mail server and one per remote database
   user, restricting traffic to those applications. This gives the
   traffic analyst some information, however. He or she can distinguish
   the tunnels by looking at information in the ESP header and, given
   that distinction and the patterns of tunnel usage, might be able to
   figure out something useful. Perhaps not, but why take the risk?

   We suggest instead that you build one tunnel per branch office,
   encrypting everything passing from head office to branches. This has a
   number of advantages:
     * it is easier to build and administer
     * it resists traffic analysis somewhat better
     * it provides security for whatever you forgot. For example, if some
       user at a remote office browses proprietary company data on some
       head office web page (that the security people may not even know
       about!), then that data is encrypted before it reaches the
       Internet.

   Of course you might also want to add additional tunnels. For example,
   if some of the database data is confidential and should not be exposed
   even within the company, then you need protection from the user's
   desktop to the database server. We suggest you do that in whatever way
   seems appropriate -- IPsec, SSH or SSL might fit -- but, whatever you
   choose, pass it between locations via a gateway-to-gateway IPsec
   tunnel to provide some resistance to traffic analysis.

Cryptographic components

   IPsec combines a number of cryptographic techniques, all of them
   well-known and well-analyzed. The overall design approach was
   conservative; no new or poorly-understood components were included.

   This section gives a brief overview of each technique. It is intended
   only as an introduction. There is more information, and links to
   related topics, in our[2205] glossary. See also our[2206] bibliography
   and cryptography[2207] web links.

  Block ciphers

   The[2208] encryption in the[2209] ESP encapsulation protocol is done
   with a[2210] block cipher .

   We do not implement[2211] single DES. It is[2212] insecure. Our
   default, and currently only, block cipher is[2213] triple DES.

   The[2214] Rijndael block cipher has won the[2215] AES competition to
   choose a relacement for DES. It will almost certainly be added to
   FreeS/WAN and to other IPsec implementations.[2216] Patches are
   already available.

  Hash functions

    The HMAC construct

   IPsec packet authentication is done with the[2217] HMAC construct.
   This is not just a hash of the packet data, but a more complex
   operation which uses both a hashing algorithm and a key. It therefore
   does more than a simple hash would. A simple hash would only tell you
   that the packet data was not changed in transit, or that whoever
   changed it also regenerated the hash. An HMAC also tells you that the
   sender knew the HMAC key.

   For IPsec HMAC, the output of the hash algorithm is truncated to 96
   bits. This saves some space in the packets. More important, it
   prevents an attacker from seeing all the hash output bits and perhaps
   creating some sort of attack based on that knowledge.

    Choice of hash algorithm

   The IPsec RFCs require two hash algorithms --[2218] MD5 and[2219]
   SHA-1 -- both of which FreeS/WAN implements.

   Various other algorithms -- such as RIPEMD and Tiger -- are listed in
   the RFCs as optional. None of these are in the FreeS/WAN distribution,
   or are likely to be added, although user[2220] patches exist for
   several of them.

   Additional hash algorithms --[2221] SHA-256, SHA-384 and SHA-512 --
   may be required to give hash strength matching the strength of[2222]
   AES. These are likely to be added to FreeS/WAN along with AES.

  Diffie-Hellman key agreement

   The[2223] Diffie-Hellman key agreement protocol allows two parties (A
   and B or[2224] Alice and Bob) to agree on a key in such a way that an
   eavesdropper who intercepts the entire conversation cannot learn the
   key.

   The protocol is based on the[2225] discrete logarithm problem and is
   therefore thought to be secure. Mathematicians have been working on
   that problem for years and seem no closer to a solution, though there
   is no proof that an efficient solution is impossible.

  RSA authentication

   The[2226] RSA algorithm (named for its inventors -- Rivest, Shamir and
   Adleman) is a very widely used[2227] public key cryptographic
   technique. It is used in IPsec as one method of authenticating
   gateways for Diffie-Hellman key negotiation.

Structure of IPsec

   There are three protocols used in an IPsec implementation:

   ESP, Encapsulating Security Payload
          Encrypts and/or authenticates data

   AH, Authentication Header
          Provides a packet authentication service

   IKE, Internet Key Exchange
          Negotiates connection parameters, including keys, for the other
          two

   The term "IPsec" is slightly ambiguous. In some contexts, it includes
   all three of the above but in other contexts it refers only to AH and
   ESP.

  IKE (Internet Key Exchange)

   The IKE protocol sets up IPsec (ESP or AH) connections after
   negotiating appropriate parameters (algorithms to be used, keys,
   connection lifetimes) for them. This is done by exchanging packets on
   UDP port 500 between the two gateways.

   IKE (RFC 2409) was the outcome of a long, complex process in which
   quite a number of protocols were proposed and debated. Oversimplifying
   mildly, IKE combines:

   ISAKMP (RFC 2408)
          The Internet Security A ssociation and Key Management Protocol
          manages negotiation of connections and defines[2228] SAs
          (Security Associations) as a means of describing connection
          properties.

   IPsec DOI for ISAKMP (RFC 2407)
          A Domain Of I nterpretation fills in the details necessary to
          turn the rather abstract ISAKMP protocol into a more tightly
          specified protocol, so it becomes applicable in a particular
          domain.

   Oakley key determination protocol (RFC 2412)
          Oakley creates keys using the[2229] Diffie-Hellman key
          agreement protocol.

   For all the details, you would need to read the four[2230] RFCs just
   mentioned (over 200 pages) and a number of others. We give a summary
   below, but it is far from complete.

    Phases of IKE

   IKE negotiations have two phases.

   Phase one
          The two gateways negotiate and set up a two-way ISAKMP SA which
          they can then use to handle phase two negotiations. One such SA
          between a pair of gateways can handle negotiations for multiple
          tunnels.

   Phase two
          Using the ISAKMP SA, the gateways negotiate IPsec (ESP and/or
          AH) SAs as required. IPsec SAs are unidirectional (a different
          key is used in each direction) and are always negotiated in
          pairs to handle two-way traffic. There may be more than one
          pair defined between two gateways.

   Both of these phases use the UDP protocol and port 500 for their
   negotiations.

   After both IKE phases are complete, you have IPsec SAs to carry your
   encrypted data. These use the ESP or AH protocols. These protocols do
   not have ports. Ports apply only to UDP or TCP.

   The IKE protocol is designed to be extremely flexible. Among the
   things that can be negotiated (separately for each SA) are:
     * SA lifetime before rekeying
     * encryption algorithm used. We currently support only[2231] triple
       DES. Single DES is[2232] insecure. The RFCs say you MUST do DES,
       SHOULD do 3DES and MAY do various others. We do not do any of the
       others.
     * authentication algorithms. We support[2233] MD5 and[2234] SHA.
       These are the two the RFCs require.
     * choice of group for[2235] Diffie-Hellman key agreement. We
       currently support Groups 2 and 5 (which are defined modulo primes
       of various lengths) and do not support Group 1 (defined modulo a
       shorter prime, and therefore cryptographically weak) or groups 3
       and 4 (defined using elliptic curves). The RFCs require only Group
       1.

   The protocol also allows implementations to add their own encryption
   algorithms, authentication algorithms or Diffie-Hellman groups. We do
   not support any such extensions, but there are some[2236] patches that
   do.

   There are a number of complications:
     * The gateways must be able to authenticate each other's identities
       before they can create a secure connection. This host
       authentication is part of phase one negotiations, and is a
       required prerequisite for packet authentication used later. Host
       authentication can be done in a variety of ways. Those supported
       by FreeS/WAN are discussed in our[2237] advanced configuration
       document.
     * Phase one can be done in two ways.
          + Main Mode is required by the RFCs and supported in FreeS/WAN.
            It uses a 6-packet exzchange.
          + Aggressive Mode is somewhat faster (only 3 packets) but
            reveals more to an eavesdropper. This is optional in the
            RFCs, not currently supported by FreeS/WAN, and not likely to
            be.
     * A new group exchange may take place after phase one but before
       phase two, defining an additional group for use in the[2238]
       Diffie-Hellman key agreement part of phase two. FreeS/WAN does not
       currently support this.
     * Phase two always uses Quick Mode, but there are two variants of
       that:
          + One variant provides[2239] Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) . An
            attacker that obtains your long-term host authentication key
            does not immediately get any of your short-term packet
            encryption of packet authentication keys. He must conduct
            another successful attack each time you rekey to get the
            short-term keys. Having some short-term keys does not help
            him learn others. In particular, breaking your system today
            does not let him read messages he archived yestarday,
            assuming you've changed short-term keys in the meanwhile. We
            enable PFS as the default.
          + The other variant disables PFS and is therefore slightly
            faster. We do not recommend this since it is less secure, but
            FreeS/WAN does support it. You can enable it with a pfs=no
            statement in[2240] ipsec.conf(5).
          + The protocol provides no way to negotiate which variant will
            be used. If one gateway is set for PFS and the other is not,
            the negotiation fails. This has proved a fairly common source
            of interoperation problems.
     * Several types of notification message may be sent by either side
       during either phase, or later. FreeS/WAN does not currently
       support these, but they are a likely addition in future releases.
     * There is a commit flag which may optionally be set on some
       messages. The[2241] errata page for the RFCs includes two changes
       related to this, one to clarify the description of its use and one
       to block a[2242] denial of service attack which uses it. We
       currently do not implement this feature.

   These complications can of course lead to problems, particularly when
   two different implementations attempt to interoperate. For example, we
   have seen problems such as:
     * Some implementations (often products crippled by[2243] export
       laws) have the insecure DES algorithm as their only supported
       encryption method. Other parts of our documentation discuss
       the[2244] reasons we do not implement single DES, and[2245] how to
       cope with crippled products .
     * Windows 2000 IPsec tries to negotiate using Aggressive Mode, which
       we don't support. Later on, it uses the commit bit, which we also
       don't support.
     * Various implementations disable PFS by default, and therefore will
       not talk to FreeS/WAN until you either turn on PFS on their end or
       turn it off in FreeS/WAN with a pfs=no entry in the connection
       description.
     * FreeS/WAN's interaction with PGPnet is complicated by their use of
       notification messages we do not yet support.

   Despite this, we do interoperate successfully with many
   implementations, including both Windows 2000 and PGPnet. Details are
   in our[2246] interoperability document.

    Sequence of messages in IKE

   Each phase (see[2247] previous section)of IKE involves a series of
   messages. In Pluto error messages, these are abbreviated using:

   M
          Main mode, settting up the keying channel (ISAKMP SA)

   Q
          Quick mode, setting up the data channel (IPsec SA)

   I
          Initiator, the machine that starts the negotiation

   R
          Responder

   For example, the six messages of a main mode negotiation, in sequence,
   are labelled:
       MI1 ---------->
           <---------- MR1
       MI2 ---------->
           <---------- MR2
       MI3 ---------->
           <---------- MR3

    Structure of IKE messages

   Here is our Pluto developer explaining some of this on the mailing
   list:
When one IKE system (for example, Pluto) is negotiating with another
to create an SA, the Initiator proposes a bunch of choices and the
Responder replies with one that it has selected.

The structure of the choices is fairly complicated.  An SA payload
contains a list of lists of "Proposals".  The outer list is a set of
choices: the selection must be from one element of this list.

Each of these elements is a list of Proposals.  A selection must be
made from each of the elements of the inner list.  In other words,
*all* of them apply (that is how, for example, both AH and ESP can
apply at once).

Within each of these Proposals is a list of Transforms.  For each
Proposal selected, one Transform must be selected (in other words,
each Proposal provides a choice of Transforms).

Each Transform is made up of a list of Attributes describing, well,
attributes.  Such as lifetime of the SA.  Such as algorithm to be
used.  All the Attributes apply to a Transform.

You will have noticed a pattern here: layers alternate between being
disjunctions ("or") and conjunctions ("and").

For Phase 1 / Main Mode (negotiating an ISAKMP SA), this structure is
cut back.  There must be exactly one Proposal.  So this degenerates to
a list of Transforms, one of which must be chosen.

  IPsec Services, AH and ESP

   IPsec offers two services,[2248] authentication and[2249] encryption.
   These can be used separately but are often used together.

   Authentication
          Packet-level authentication allows you to be confident that a
          packet came from a particular machine and that its contents
          were not altered en route to you. No attempt is made to conceal
          or protect the contents, only to assure their integrity. Packet
          authentication can be provided separately using an[2250]
          Authentication Header, described just below, or it can be
          included as part of the[2251] ESP (Encapsulated Security
          Payload) service, described in the following section. That
          service offers encryption as well as authentication. In either
          case, the[2252] HMAC construct is used as the authentication
          mechanism.

          There is a separate authentication operation at the IKE level,
          in which each gateway authenticates the other. This can be done
          in a variety of ways.

   Encryption
          Encryption allows you to conceal the contents of a message from
          eavesdroppers.

          In IPsec this is done using a[2253] block cipher
          (normally[2254] Triple DES for Linux). In the most used setup,
          keys are automatically negotiated, and periodically
          re-negotiated, using the[2255] IKE (Internet Key Exchange)
          protocol. In Linux FreeS/WAN this is handled by the Pluto
          Daemon.

          The IPsec protocol offering encryption is[2256] ESP,
          Encapsulated Security Payload. It can also include a packet
          authentication service.

   Note that encryption should always be used with some packet
   authentication service. Unauthenticated encryption is vulnerable
   to[2257] man-in-the-middle attacks. Also note that encryption does not
   prevent[2258] traffic analysis.

  The Authentication Header (AH)

   Packet authentication can be provided separately from encryption by
   adding an authentication header (AH) after the IP header but before
   the other headers on the packet. This is the subject of this section.
   Details are in RFC 2402.

   Each of the several headers on a packet header contains a "next
   protocol" field telling the system what header to look for next. IP
   headers generally have either TCP or UDP in this field. When IPsec
   authentication is used, the packet IP header has AH in this field,
   saying that an Authentication Header comes next. The AH header then
   has the next header type -- usually TCP, UDP or encapsulated IP.

   IPsec packet authentication can be added in transport mode, as a
   modification of standard IP transport. This is shown in this diagram
   from the RFC:
                  BEFORE APPLYING AH
            ----------------------------
      IPv4  |orig IP hdr  |     |      |
            |(any options)| TCP | Data |
            ----------------------------

                  AFTER APPLYING AH
            ---------------------------------
      IPv4  |orig IP hdr  |    |     |      |
            |(any options)| AH | TCP | Data |
            ---------------------------------
            ||
                 except for mutable fields

   Athentication can also be used in tunnel mode, encapsulating the
   underlying IP packet beneath AH and an additional IP header.
                         ||
IPv4  | new IP hdr* |    | orig IP hdr*  |    |      |
      |(any options)| AH | (any options) |TCP | Data |
      ------------------------------------------------
      ||
      |           in the new IP hdr                  |

   This would normally be used in a gateway-to-gateway tunnel. The
   receiving gateway then strips the outer IP header and the AH header
   and forwards the inner IP packet.

   The mutable fields referred to are things like the time-to-live field
   in the IP header. These cannot be included in authentication
   calculations because they change as the packet travels.

    Keyed MD5 and Keyed SHA

   The actual authentication data in the header is typically 96 bits and
   depends both on a secret shared between sender and receiver and on
   every byte of the data being authenticated. The technique used
   is[2259] HMAC, defined in RFC 2104.

   The algorithms involved are the[2260] MD5 Message Digest Algorithm
   or[2261] SHA, the Secure Hash Algorithm. For details on their use in
   this application, see RFCs 2403 and 2404 respectively.

   For descriptions of the algorithms themselves, see RFC 1321 for MD5
   and[2262] FIPS (Federal Information Processing Standard) number 186
   from[2263] NIST, the US National Institute of Standards and Technology
   for SHA.[2264] Applied Cryptography covers both in some detail, MD5
   starting on page 436 and SHA on 442.

   These algorithms are intended to make it nearly impossible for anyone
   to alter the authenticated data in transit. The sender calculates a
   digest or hash value from that data and includes the result in the
   authentication header. The recipient does the same calculation and
   compares results. For unchanged data, the results will be identical.
   The hash algorithms are designed to make it extremely difficult to
   change the data in any way and still get the correct hash.

   Since the shared secret key is also used in both calculations, an
   interceptor cannot simply alter the authenticated data and change the
   hash value to match. Without the key, he or she (or even the dreaded
   They) cannot produce a usable hash.

    Sequence numbers

   The authentication header includes a sequence number field which the
   sender is required to increment for each packet. The receiver can
   ignore it or use it to check that packets are indeed arriving in the
   expected sequence.

   This provides partial protection against[2265] replay attacks in which
   an attacker resends intercepted packets in an effort to confuse or
   subvert the receiver. Complete protection is not possible since it is
   necessary to handle legitmate packets which are lost, duplicated, or
   delivered out of order, but use of sequence numbers makes the attack
   much more difficult.

   The RFCs require that sequence numbers never cycle, that a new key
   always be negotiated before the sequence number reaches 2^32-1. This
   protects both against replays attacks using packets from a previous
   cyclce and against[2266] birthday attacks on the the packet
   authentication algorithm.

   In Linux FreeS/WAN, the sequence number is ignored for manually keyed
   connections and checked for automatically keyed ones. In manual mode,
   there is no way to negotiate a new key, or to recover from a sequence
   number problem, so we don't use sequence numbers.

  Encapsulated Security Payload (ESP)

   The ESP protocol is defined in RFC 2406. It provides one or both of
   encryption and packet authentication. It may be used with or without
   AH packet authentication.

   Note that some form of packet authentication should always be used
   whenever data is encrypted. Without authentication, the encryption is
   vulnerable to active attacks which may allow an enemy to break the
   encryption. ESP should always either include its own authentication or
   be used with AH authentication.

   The RFCs require support for only two mandatory encryption algorithms
   --[2267] DES, and null encryption -- and for two authentication
   methods -- keyed MD5 and keyed SHA. Implementers may choose to support
   additional algorithms in either category.

   The authentication algorithms are the same ones used in the
   IPsec[2268] authentication header.

   We do not implement single DES since[2269] DES is insecure. Instead we
   provide[2270] triple DES or 3DES . This is currently the only
   encryption algorithm supported.

   We do not implement null encryption since it is obviously insecure.

IPsec modes

   IPsec can connect in two modes. Transport mode is a host-to-host
   connection involving only two machines. In tunnel mode, the IPsec
   machines act as gateways and trafiic for any number of client machines
   may be carried.

  Tunnel mode

   Security gateways are required to support tunnel mode connections. In
   this mode the gateways provide tunnels for use by client machines
   behind the gateways. The client machines need not do any IPsec
   processing; all they have to do is route things to gateways.

  Transport mode

   Host machines (as opposed to security gateways) with IPsec
   implementations must also support transport mode. In this mode, the
   host does its own IPsec processing and routes some packets via IPsec.

FreeS/WAN parts

  KLIPS: Kernel IPsec Support

   KLIPS is KerneL IP SEC Support, the modifications necessary to support
   IPsec within the Linux kernel. KILPS does all the actual IPsec
   packet-handling, including
     * encryption
     * packet authentication calculations
     * creation of ESP and AH headers for outgoing packets
     * interpretation of those headers on incoming packets

   KLIPS also checks all non-IPsec packets to ensure they are not
   bypassing IPsec security policies.

  The Pluto daemon

   [2271]Pluto(8) is a daemon which implements the IKE protocol. It
     * handles all the Phase one ISAKMP SAs
     * performs host authentication and negotiates with other gateways
     * creates IPsec SAs and passes the data required to run them to
       KLIPS
     * adjust routing and firewall setup to meet IPsec requirements. See
       our[2272] IPsec and firewalling document for details.

   Pluto is controlled mainly by the[2273] ipsec.conf(5) configuration
   file.

  The ipsec(8) command

   The[2274] ipsec(8) command is a front end shellscript that allows
   control over IPsec activity.

  Linux FreeS/WAN configuration file

   The configuration file for Linux FreeS/WAN is
        /etc/ipsec.conf

   For details see the[2275] ipsec.conf(5) manual page .

Key management

   There are several ways IPsec can manage keys. Not all are implemented
   in Linux FreeS/WAN.

  Currently Implemented Methods

    Manual keying

   IPsec allows keys to be manually set. In Linux FreeS/WAN, such keys
   are stored with the connection definitions in /etc/ipsec.conf.

   [2276]Manual keying is useful for debugging since it allows you to
   test the[2277] KLIPS kernel IPsec code without the[2278] Pluto daemon
   doing key negotiation.

   In general, however, automatic keying is preferred because it is more
   secure.

    Automatic keying

   In automatic keying, the[2279] Pluto daemon negotiates keys using
   the[2280] IKE Internet Key Exchange protocol. Connections are
   automatically re-keyed periodically.

   This is considerably more secure than manual keying. In either case an
   attacker who acquires a key can read every message encrypted with that
   key, but automatic keys can be changed every few hours or even every
   few minutes without breaking the connection or requiring intervention
   by the system administrators. Manual keys can only be changed
   manually; you need to shut down the connection and have the two admins
   make changes. Moreover, they have to communicate the new keys
   securely, perhaps with[2281] PGP or[2282] SSH . This may be possible
   in some cases, but as a general solution it is expensive, bothersome
   and unreliable. Far better to let[2283] Pluto handle these chores; no
   doubt the administrators have enough to do.

   Also, automatic keying is inherently more secure against an attacker
   who manages to subvert your gateway system. If manual keying is in use
   and an adversary acquires root privilege on your gateway, he reads
   your keys from /etc/ipsec.conf and then reads all messages encrypted
   with those keys.

   If automatic keying is used, an adversary with the same privileges can
   read /etc/ipsec.secrets, but this does not contain any keys, only the
   secrets used to authenticate key exchanges. Having an adversary able
   to authenticate your key exchanges need not worry you overmuch. Just
   having the secrets does not give him any keys. You are still secure
   against[2284] passive attacks. This property of automatic keying is
   called[2285] perfect forward secrecy, abbreviated PFS.

   Unfortunately, having the secrets does allow an[2286] active attack,
   specifically a[2287] man-in-the-middle attack. Losing these secrets to
   an attacker may not be quite as disastrous as losing the actual keys,
   but it is still a serious security breach. These secrets should be
   guarded as carefully as keys.

  Methods not yet implemented

    Unauthenticated key exchange

   It would be possible to exchange keys without authenticating the
   players. This would support[2288] opportunistic encryption -- allowing
   any two systems to encrypt their communications without requiring a
   shared PKI or a previously negotiated secret -- and would be secure
   against[2289] passive attacks. It would, however, be highly vulnerable
   to active[2290] man-in-the-middle attacks. RFC 2408 therefore
   specifies that all[2291] ISAKMP key management interactions must be
   authenticated.

   There is room for debate here. Should we provide immediate security
   against[2292] passive attacks and encourage widespread use of
   encryption, at the expense of risking the more difficult[2293] active
   attacks? Or should we wait until we can implement a solution that can
   both be widespread and offer security against active attacks?

   So far, we have chosen the second course, complying with the RFCs and
   waiting for secure DNS (see[2294] below) so that we can do[2295]
   opportunistic encryption right.

    Key exchange using DNS

   The IPsec RFCs allow key exchange based on authentication services
   provided by[2296] Secure DNS. Once Secure DNS service becomes widely
   available, we expect to make this the primary key management method
   for Linux FreeS/WAN. It is the best way we know of to support[2297]
   opportunistic encryption, allowing two systems without a common PKI or
   previous negotiation to secure their communication.

   We currently have code to acquire RSA keys from DNS but do not yet
   have code to validate Secure DNS signatures.

    Key exchange using a PKI

   The IPsec RFCs allow key exchange based on authentication services
   provided by a[2298] PKI or Public Key Infrastructure. With many
   vendors selling such products and many large organisations building
   these infrastructures, this will clearly be an important application
   of IPsec and one Linux FreeS/WAN will eventually support.

   On the other hand, this is not as high a priority for Linux FreeS/WAN
   as solutions based on[2299] secure DNS. We do not expect any PKI to
   become as universal as DNS.

   Some[2300] patches to handle authentication with X.509 certificates,
   which most PKIs use, are available.

    Photuris

   [2301]Photuris is another key management protocol, an alternative to
   IKE and ISAKMP, described in RFCs 2522 and 2523 which are labelled
   "experimental". Adding Photuris support to Linux FreeS/WAN might be a
   good project for a volunteer. The likely starting point would be the
   OpenBSD photurisd code.

    SKIP

   [2302]SKIP is yet another key management protocol, developed by Sun.
   At one point it was fairly widely used, but it now seems moribund,
   displaced by IKE. Sun now (as of Solaris 8.0) ship an IPsec
   implementation using IKE. We have no plans to implement SKIP. If a
   user were to implement it, we would almost certainly not want to add
   the code to our distribution.

                         Mailing lists and newsgroups

Mailing lists about FreeS/WAN

  The project mailing lists

   The Linux FreeS/WAN project has several email lists for user support,
   bug reports and software development discussions.

   We had a single list on clinet.fi for several years (Thanks, folks!),
   then one list on freeswan.org, but now we've split into several lists:

   [2303]users

          + The general list for discussing use of the software
          + The place for seeking help with problems (but please check
            the[2304] FAQ first).
          + Anyone can post.

   [2305]bugs

          + For bug reports.
          + If you are not certain what is going on -- could be a bug, a
            configuration error, a network problem, ... -- please post to
            the users list instead.
          + Anyone can post.

   [2306]design

          + Design discussions, for people working on FreeS/WAN
            development or others with an interest in design and security
            issues.
          + It would be a good idea to read the existing design papers
            (see this[2307] list) before posting.
          + Anyone can post.

   [2308]announce

          + A low-traffic list.
          + Announcements about FreeS/WAN and related software.
          + All posts here are also sent to the users list. You need not
            subscribe to both.
          + Only the FreeS/WAN team can post.
          + If you have something you feel should go on this list, send
            it to announce-admin@lists.freeswan.org. Unless it is
            obvious, please include a short note explaining why we should
            post it.

   [2309]briefs

          + A low-traffic list.
          + Weekly summaries of activity on the users list.
          + All posts here are also sent to the users list. You need not
            subscribe to both.
          + Only the FreeS/WAN team can post.

   To subscribe to any of these, you can:
     * just follow the links above
     * use our[2310] web interface
     * send mail to listname-request@lists.freeswan.org with a one-line
       message body "subscribe"

   Archives of these lists are available via the[2311] web interface.

    Which list should I use?

   For most questions, please check the[2312] FAQ first, and if that does
   not have an answer, ask on the users list. "My configuration doesn't
   work." does not belong on the bugs list, and "Can FreeS/WAN do
   such-and-such" or "How do I configure it to..." do not belong in
   design discussions.

   Cross-posting the same message to two or more of these lists is
   discouraged. Quite a few people read more than one list and getting
   multiple copies is annoying.

    List policies

   US citizens or residents are asked not to post code to the lists, not
   even one-line bug fixes. The project cannot accept code which might
   entangle it in US[2313] export restrictions .

   Non-subscribers can post to some of these lists. This is necessary;
   someone working on a gateway install who encounters a problem may not
   have access to a subscribed account.

   Some spam turns up on these lists from time to time. For discussion of
   why we do not attempt to filter it, see the[2314] FAQ. Please do not
   clutter the lists with complaints about this.

  Archives of the lists

   Searchable archives of the old single list have existed for some time.
   At time of writing, it is not yet clear how they will change for the
   new multi-list structure.
     * [2315]Canada
     * [2316]Holland

   Note that these use different search engines. Try both.

   Archives of the new lists are available via the[2317] web interface.

Indexes of mailing lists

   [2318]PAML is the standard reference for Publicly Accessible Mailing
   Lists. When we last checked, it had over 7500 lists on an amazing
   variety of topics. It also has FAQ information and a search engine.

   There is an index of[2319] Linux mailing lists available.

   A list of[2320] computer security mailing lists, with descriptions.

Lists for related software and topics

   Most links in this section point to subscription addresses for the
   various lists. Send the one-line message "subscribe list_name " to
   subscribe to any of them.

  Products that include FreeS/WAN

   Our introduction document gives a[2321] list of products that include
   FreeS/WAN. If you have, or are considering, one of those, check the
   supplier's web site for information on mailing lists for their users.

  Linux mailing lists

                                   Web links

The Linux FreeS/WAN Project

   The main project web site is[2341] www.freeswan.org.

   Links to other project-related[2342] sites are provided in our
   introduction section.

  Add-ons and patches for FreeS/WAN

   Some user-contributed patches have been integrated into the FreeS/WAN
   distribution. For a variety of reasons, those listed below have not.

   Note that not all patches are a good idea.
     * There are a number of "features" of IPsec which we do not
       implement because they reduce security. See this[2343] discussion
       . We do not recommend using patches that implement these. One
       example is aggressive mode.
     * We do not recommend adding "features" of any sort unless they are
       clearly necessary, or at least have clear benefits. For example,
       FreeS/WAN would not become more secure if it offerred a choice of
       14 ciphers. If even one was flawed, it would certainly become less
       secure for anyone using that cipher. Even with 14 wonderful
       ciphers, it would be harder to maintain and administer, hence more
       vulnerable to various human errors.

   This is not to say that patches are necessarily bad, only that using
   them requires some deliberation. For example, there might be perfectly
   good reasons to add a specific cipher in your application: perhaps
   GOST to comply with government standards in Eastern Europe, or AES for
   performance benefits.

    Current patches

   Patches believed current::
     * patches for[2344] X.509 certificate support, also available from
       a[2345] mirror site
     * patches to add[2346] AES and other ciphers. There is preliminary
       data indicating AES gives a substantial[2347] performance gain.

   There is also one add-on that takes the form of a modified FreeS/WAN
   distribution, rather than just patches to the standard distribution:
     * [2348]IPv6 support

   Before using any of the above,, check the[2349] mailing lists for news
   of newer versions and to see whether they have been incorporated into
   more recent versions of FreeS/WAN.

    Older patches

     * [2350]hardware acceleration
     * a[2351] series of patches that
          + provide GOST, a Russian gov't. standard cipher, in MMX
            assembler
          + add GOST to OpenSSL
          + add GOST to the International kernel patch
          + let FreeS/WAN use International kernel patch ciphers
     * Neil Dunbar's patches for[2352] certificate support, using code
       from[2353] Open SSL.
     * Luc Lanthier's[2354] patches for[2355] PKIX support.
     * [2356]patches to add[2357] Blowfish,[2358] IDEA and[2359] CAST-128
       to FreeS/WAN
     * patches for FreeS/WAN 1.3, Pluto support for[2360] external
       authentication, for example with a smartcard or SKEYID.
     * [2361]patches and utilities for using FreeS/WAN with PGPnet
     * [2362]Blowfish encryption and Tiger hash
     * [2363]patches for aggressive mode support

   These patches are for older versions of FreeS/WAN and will likely not
   work with the current version. Older versions of FreeS/WAN may be
   available on some of the[2364] distribution sites, but we recommend
   using the current release.

    VPN masquerade patches

   Finally, there are some patches to other code that may be useful with
   FreeS/WAN:
     * a[2365] patch to make IPsec, PPTP and SSH VPNs work through a
       Linux firewall with[2366] IP masquerade.
     * [2367]Linux VPN Masquerade HOWTO

   Note that this is not required if the same machine does IPsec and
   masquerading, only if you want a to locate your IPsec gateway on a
   masqueraded network. See our[2368] firewalls document for discussion
   of why this is problematic.

   At last report, this patch could not co-exist with FreeS/WAN on the
   same machine.

  Distributions including FreeS/WAN

   The introductory section of our document set lists several[2369] Linux
   distributions which include FreeS/WAN.

  Things FreeS/WAN uses or could use

     * [2370]/dev/random support page, discussion of and code for the
       Linux[2371] random number driver. Out-of-date when we last checked
       (January 2000), but still useful.
     * other programs related to random numbers:
          + [2372]audio entropy daemon to gather noise from a sound card
            and feed it into /dev/random
          + an[2373] entropy-gathering daemon
          + a driver for the random number generator in recent[2374]
            Intel chipsets. This driver is included as standard in 2.4
            kernels.
     * a Linux[2375] L2TP Daemon which might be useful for communicating
       with Windows 2000 which builds L2TP tunnels over its IPsec
       connections
     * to use opportunistic encryption, you need a recent version
       of[2376] BIND. You can get one from the[2377] Internet Software
       Consortium who maintain BIND.

  Other approaches to VPNs for Linux

     * other Linux[2378] IPsec implementations
     * [2379]ENskip, a free implementation of Sun's[2380] SKIP protocol
     * [2381]vpnd, a non-IPsec VPN daemon for Linux which creates tunnels
       using[2382] Blowfish encryption
     * [2383]Zebedee, a simple GPLd tunnel-building program with Linux
       and Win32 versions. The name is from Zlib compression, Blowfish
       encryption and Diffie-Hellman key exchange.
     * There are at least two PPTP implementations for Linux
          + Moreton Bay's[2384] PoPToP
          + [2385]PPTP-Linux

IPsec Implementations

  Linux products

   Vendors using FreeS/WAN in turnkey firewall or VPN products are listed
   in our[2422] introduction.

   Other vendors have Linux IPsec products which, as far as we know, do
   not use FreeS/WAN
     * [2423]Redcreek provide an open source Linux driver for their PCI
       hardware VPN card. This card has a 100 Mbit Ethernet port, an
       Intel 960 CPU plus more specialised crypto chips, and claimed
       encryption performance of 45 Mbit/sec. The PC sees it as an
       Ethernet board.
     * [2424]Paktronix offer a Linux-based VPN with hardware encryption
     * [2425]Watchguard use Linux in their Firebox product.
     * [2426]Entrust offer a developers' toolkit for using their[2427]
       PKI for IPsec authentication
     * According to a report on our mailing list,[2428] Axent have a
       Linux version of their product.

  IPsec in router products

   All the major router vendors support IPsec, at least in some models.
     * [2429]Cisco IPsec information
     * Ascend, now part of[2430] Lucent, have some IPsec-based products
     * [2431]Bay Networks, now part of Nortel, use IPsec in their
       Contivity switch product line
     * [2432]3Com have a number of VPN products, some using IPsec

  IPsec in firewall products

   Many firewall vendors offer IPsec, either as a standard part of their
   product, or an optional extra. A few we know about are:
     * [2433]Borderware
     * [2434]Ashley Laurent
     * [2435]Watchguard
     * [2436]Injoy for OS/2

   Vendors using FreeS/WAN in turnkey firewall products are listed in
   our[2437] introduction.

  Operating systems with IPsec support

   All the major open source operating systems support IPsec. See below
   for details on[2438] BSD-derived Unix variants.

   Among commercial OS vendors, IPsec players include:
     * [2439]Microsoft have put IPsec in their Windows 2000 and XP
       products
     * [2440]IBM announce a release of OS390 with IPsec support via a
       crypto co-processor
     * [2441]Sun include IPsec in Solaris 8
     * [2442]Hewlett Packard offer IPsec for their Unix machines
     * Certicom have IPsec available for the[2443] Palm.
     * There were reports before the release that Apple's Mac OS X would
       have IPsec support built in, but it did not seem to be there when
       we last checked. If you find, it please let us know via the[2444]
       mailing list.

  IPsec on network cards

   Network cards with built-in IPsec acceleration are available from at
   least Intel, 3Com and Redcreek.

  Open source IPsec implementations

    Other Linux IPsec implementations

   We like to think of FreeS/WAN as the Linux IPsec implementation, but
   it is not the only one. Others we know of are:
     * [2445]pipsecd, a lightweight implementation of IPsec for Linux.
       Does not require kernel recompilation.
     * Petr Novak's[2446] ipnsec, based on the OpenBSD IPsec code and
       using[2447] Photuris for key management
     * A now defunct project at[2448] U of Arizona (export controlled)
     * [2449]NIST Cerebus (export controlled)

    IPsec for BSD Unix

     * [2450]KAME, several large Japanese companies co-operating on IPv6
       and IPsec
     * [2451]US Naval Research Lab implementation of IPv6 and of IPsec
       for IPv4 (export controlled)
     * [2452]OpenBSD includes IPsec as a standard part of the
       distribution
     * [2453]IPsec for FreeBSD
     * a[2454] FAQ on NetBSD's IPsec implementation

    IPsec for other systems

     * [2455]Helsinki U of Technolgy have implemented IPsec for Solaris,
       Java and Macintosh

  Interoperability

   The IPsec protocols are designed so that different implementations
   should be able to work together. As they say "the devil is in the
   details". IPsec has a lot of details, but considerable success has
   been achieved.

    Interoperability results

   Linux FreeS/WAN has been tested for interoperability with many other
   IPsec implementations. Results to date are in our[2456]
   interoperability section.

   Various other sites have information on interoperability between
   various IPsec implementations:
     * [2457]interop results from a bakeoff in Atlanta, September 1999.
     * a French company, HSC's,[2458] interoperability test data covers
       FreeS/WAN, Open BSD, KAME, Linux pipsecd, Checkpoint, Red Creek
       Ravlin, and Cisco IOS
     * [2459]ICSA offer certification programs for various
       security-related products. See their list of[2460] certified IPsec
       products. Linux FreeS/WAN is not currently on that list, but
       several products with which we interoperate are.
     * VPNC have a page on why they are not yet doing[2461]
       interoperability testing and a page on the[2462] spec conformance
       testing that they are doing
     * a[2463] review comparing a dozen commercial IPsec implemetations.

   the[2477] Linux Documentation Project or LDP.
     * [2478]Meta-FAQ guide to Linux information sources
     * The LDP's HowTo documents are a standard Linux reference. See

          + [2482]Security HOWTO
     * The LDP do a series of Guides, book-sized publications with more
       detail (and often more "why do it this way?") than the HowTos. See

   You may not need to go to the LDP to get this material. Most Linux
   distributions include the HowTos on their CDs and several include the
   Guides as well. Also, most of the Guides and some collections of
   HowTos are available in book form from various publishers.

   3DES (Triple DES)
          Using three[2642] DES encryptions on a single data block, with
          at least two different keys, to get higher security than is
          available from a single DES pass. The three-key version of 3DES
          is the default encryption algorithm for[2643] Linux FreeS/WAN .

          [2644]IPsec always does 3DES with three different keys, as
          required by RFC 2451. For an explanation of the two-key
          variant, see[2645] two key triple DES. Both use an[2646] EDE
          encrypt-decrypt-encrpyt sequence of operations.

          Single[2647] DES is[2648] insecure .

          Double DES is ineffective. Using two 56-bit keys, one might
          expect an attacker to have to do 2^112 work to break it. In
          fact, only 2^57 work is required with a[2649]
          meet-in-the-middle attack, though a large amount of memory is
          also required. Triple DES is vulnerable to a similar attack,
          but that just reduces the work factor from the 2^168 one might
          expect to 2^ 112. That provides adequate protection
          against[2650] brute force attacks, and no better attack is
          known.

          3DES can be somewhat slow compared to other ciphers. It
          requires three DES encryptions per block. DES was designed for
          hardware implementation and includes some operations which are
          difficult in software. However, the speed we get is quite
          acceptable for many uses. See our[2651] performance document
          for details.

   A
   Active attack
          An attack in which the attacker does not merely eavesdrop
          (see[2652] passive attack) but takes action to change, delete,
          reroute, add, forge or divert data. Perhaps the best-known
          active attack is[2653] man-in-the-middle. In general,[2654]
          authentication is a useful defense against active attacks.

   AES
          The Advanced Encryption Standard -- a new[2655] block cipher
          standard to replace[2656] DES -- developed by[2657] NIST, the
          US National Institute of Standards and Technology. DES used
          64-bit blocks and a 56-bit key. AES ciphers use a 128-bit block
          and 128, 192 or 256-bit keys. The larger block size helps
          resist[2658] birthday attacks while the large key size
          prevents[2659] brute force attacks.

          Fifteen proposals meeting NIST's basic criteria were submitted
          in 1998 and subjected to intense discussion and analysis,
          "round one" evaluation. In August 1999, NIST narrowed the field
          to five "round two" candidates:

          + [2660]Mars from IBM
          + [2661]RC6 from RSA
          + [2662]Rijndael from two Belgian researchers
          + [2663]Serpent, a British-Norwegian-Israeli collaboration
          + [2664]Twofish from the consulting firm[2665] Counterpane

          Three of the five finalists -- Rijndael, Serpent and Twofish --
          have completely open licenses.

          In October 2000, NIST announced the winner -- Rijndael.

          For more information, see:

          + NIST's[2666] AES home page
          + the Block Cipher Lounge[2667] AES page
          + Brian Gladman's[2668] code and benchmarks
          + Helger Lipmaa's[2669] survey of implementations

          AES will be added to a future release of[2670] Linux FreeS/WAN.
          Likely we will add all three of the finalists with good
          licenses. User-written[2671] AES patches are already available.

          Adding AES may also require adding stronger hashes,[2672]
          SHA-256, SHA-384 and SHA-512.

   Authentication
          Ensuring that a message originated from the expected sender and
          has not been altered on route.[2679] IPsec uses authentication
          in two places:

          + peer authentication, authenticating the players in[2680]
            IKE's[2681] Diffie-Hellman key exchanges to prevent[2682]
            man-in-the-middle attacks. This can be done in a number of
            ways. The methods supported by FreeS/WAN are discussed in
            our[2683] advanced configuration document.
          + packet authentication, authenticating packets on an
            established[2684] SA, either with a separate[2685]
            authentication header or with the optional authentication in
            the[2686] ESP protocol. In either case, packet authentication
            uses a[2687] hashed message athentication code technique.

          Outside IPsec, passwords are perhaps the most common
          authentication mechanism. Their function is essentially to
          authenticate the person's identity to the system. Passwords are
          generally only as secure as the network they travel over. If
          you send a cleartext password over a tapped phone line or over
          a network with a packet sniffer on it, the security provided by
          that password becomes zero. Sending an encrypted password is no
          better; the attacker merely records it and reuses it at his
          convenience. This is called a[2688] replay attack.

          A common solution to this problem is a[2689] challenge-response
          system. This defeats simple eavesdropping and replay attacks.
          Of course an attacker might still try to break the
          cryptographic algorithm used, or the[2690] random number
          generator.

   Automatic keying
          A mode in which keys are automatically generated at connection
          establisment and new keys automaically created periodically
          thereafter. Contrast with[2691] manual keying in which a single
          stored key is used.

          IPsec uses the[2692] Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol to
          create keys. An[2693] authentication mechansim is required for
          this. FreeS/WAN normally uses[2694] RSA for this. Other methods
          supported are discussed in our[2695] advanced configuration
          document.

          Having an attacker break the authentication is emphatically not
          a good idea. An attacker that breaks authentication, and
          manages to subvert some other network entities (DNS, routers or
          gateways), can use a[2696] man-in-the middle attack to break
          the security of your IPsec connections.

          However, having an attacker break the authentication in
          automatic keying is not quite as bad as losing the key in
          manual keying.

          + An attacker who reads /etc/ipsec.conf and gets the keys for a
            manually keyed connection can, without further effort, read
            all messages encrypted with those keys, including any old
            messages he may have archived.
          + Automatic keying has a property called[2697] perfect forward
            secrecy. An attacker who breaks the authentication gets none
            of the automatically generated keys and cannot immediately
            read any messages. He has to mount a successful[2698]
            man-in-the-middle attack in real time before he can read
            anything. He cannot read old archived messages at all and
            will not be able to read any future messages not caught by
            man-in-the-middle tricks.

          That said, the secrets used for authentication, stored in[2699]
          ipsec.secrets(5), should still be protected as tightly as
          cryptographic keys.

   B
   [2700]Bay Networks
          A vendor of routers, hubs and related products, now a
          subsidiary of Nortel. Interoperation between their IPsec
          products and Linux FreeS/WAN was problematic at last report;
          see our[2701] interoperation section.

   benchmarks
          Our default block cipher,[2702] triple DES, is slower than many
          alternate ciphers that might be used. Speeds achieved, however,
          seem adequate for many purposes. For example, the assembler

   Birthday attack
          A cryptographic attack based on the mathematics exemplified by
          the[2708] birthday paradox. This math turns up whenever the
          question of two cryptographic operations producing the same
          result becomes an issue:

          + [2709]collisions in[2710] message digest functions.
          + identical output blocks from a[2711] block cipher
          + repetition of a challenge in a[2712] challenge-response
            system

          Resisting such attacks is part of the motivation for:

          + hash algorithms such as[2713] SHA and[2714] RIPEMD-160 giving
            a 160-bit result rather than the 128 bits of[2715] MD4,[2716]
            MD5 and[2717] RIPEMD-128.
          + [2718]AES block ciphers using a 128-bit block instead of the
            64-bit block of most current ciphers
          + [2719]IPsec using a 32-bit counter for packets sent on
            an[2720] automatically keyed[2721] SA and requiring that the
            connection always be rekeyed before the counter overflows.

   Birthday paradox
          Not really a paradox, just a rather counter-intuitive
          mathematical fact. In a group of 23 people, the chance of a
          least one pair having the same birthday is over 50%.

          The second person has 1 chance in 365 (ignoring leap years) of
          matching the first. If they don't match, the third person's
          chances of matching one of them are 2/365. The 4th, 3/365, and
          so on. The total of these chances grows more quickly than one
          might guess.

   Block cipher
          A[2722] symmetric cipher which operates on fixed-size blocks of
          plaintext, giving a block of ciphertext for each. Contrast
          with[2723] stream cipher. Block ciphers can be used in
          various[2724] modes when multiple block are to be encrypted.

          [2725]DES is among the the best known and widely used block
          ciphers, but is now obsolete. Its 56-bit key size makes
          it[2726] highly insecure today.[2727] Triple DES is the default
          block cipher for[2728] Linux FreeS/WAN.

          The current generation of block ciphers -- such as[2729]
          Blowfish,[2730] CAST-128 and[2731] IDEA -- all use 64-bit
          blocks and 128-bit keys. The next generation,[2732] AES, uses
          128-bit blocks and supports key sizes up to 256 bits.

          The[2733] Block Cipher Lounge web site has more information.

   Blowfish
          A[2734] block cipher using 64-bit blocks and keys of up to 448
          bits, designed by[2735] Bruce Schneier and used in several
          products.

          This is not required by the[2736] IPsec RFCs and not currently
          used in[2737] Linux FreeS/WAN.

   Brute force attack (exhaustive search)
          Breaking a cipher by trying all possible keys. This is always
          possible in theory (except against a[2738] one-time pad), but
          it becomes practical only if the key size is inadequate. For an
          important example, see our document on the[2739] insecurity of
          DES with its 56-bit key. For an analysis of key sizes required
          to resist plausible brute force attacks, see[2740] this paper.

          Longer keys protect against brute force attacks. Each extra bit
          in the key doubles the number of possible keys and therefore
          doubles the work a brute force attack must do. A large enough
          key defeats any brute force attack.

          For example, the EFF's[2741] DES Cracker searches a 56-bit key
          space in an average of a few days. Let us assume an attacker
          that can find a 64-bit key (256 times harder) by brute force
          search in a second (a few hundred thousand times faster). For a
          96-bit key, that attacker needs 2^32 seconds, about 135 years.
          Against a 128-bit key, he needs 2^32 times that, over
          500,000,000,000 years. Your data is then obviously secure
          against brute force attacks. Even if our estimate of the
          attacker's speed is off by a factor of a million, it still
          takes him over 500,000 years to crack a message.

          This is why

          + single[2742] DES is now considered[2743] dangerously insecure
          + all of the current generation of[2744] block ciphers use a
            128-bit or longer key
          + [2745]AES ciphers support keysizes 128, 192 and 256 bits
          + any cipher we add to Linux FreeS/WAN will have at least a
            128-bit key

          Cautions:
          Inadequate keylength always indicates a weak cipher but it is
          important to note that adequate keylength does not necessarily
          indicate a strong cipher. There are many attacks other than
          brute force, and adequate keylength only guarantees resistance
          to brute force. Any cipher, whatever its key size, will be weak
          if design or implementation flaws allow other attacks.

          Also, once you have adequate keylength (somewhere around 90 or
          100 bits), adding more key bits make no practical difference ,
          even against brute force. Consider our 128-bit example above
          that takes 500,000,000,000 years to break by brute force. We
          really don't care how many zeroes there are on the end of that,
          as long as the number remains ridiculously large. That is, we
          don't care exactly how large the key is as long as it is large
          enough.

          There may be reasons of convenience in the design of the cipher
          to support larger keys. For example[2746] Blowfish allows up to
          448 bits and[2747] RC4 up to 2048, but beyond 100-odd bits it
          makes no difference to practical security.

   C
   CA
          Certification Authority, an entity in a[2750] public key
          infrastructure that can certify keys by signing them. Usually
          CAs form a hierarchy. The top of this hierarchy is called
          the[2751] root CA.

          See[2752] Web of Trust for an alternate model.

   CAST-128
          A[2753] block cipher using 64-bit blocks and 128-bit keys,
          described in RFC 2144 and used in products such as[2754]
          Entrust and recent versions of[2755] PGP.

          This is not required by the[2756] IPsec RFCs and not currently
          used in[2757] Linux FreeS/WAN.

   CAST-256
          [2758]Entrust's candidate cipher for the[2759] AES standard,
          largely based on the[2760] CAST-128 design.

   CBC mode
          Cipher Block Chaining[2761] mode, a method of using a[2762]
          block cipher in which for each block except the first, the
          result of the previous encryption is XORed into the new block
          before it is encrypted. CBC is the mode used in[2763] IPsec.

          An[2764] initialisation vector (IV) must be provided. It is
          XORed into the first block before encryption. The IV need not
          be secret but should be different for each message and
          unpredictable.

   CIDR
          Classless Inter-Domain Routing, an addressing scheme used to
          describe networks not restricted to the old Class A, B, and C
          sizes. A CIDR block is written address/ mask, where address is
          a 32-bit Internet address. The first mask bits of address are
          part of the gateway address, while the remaining bits designate
          other host addresses. For example, the CIDR block 192.0.2.96/27
          describes a network with gateway 192.0.2.96, hosts 192.0.2.96
          through 192.0.2.126 and broadcast 192.0.2.127.

          FreeS/WAN policy group files accept CIDR blocks of the format
          address/[mask], where address may take the form
          name.domain.tld. An absent mask is assumed to be /32.

   Certification Authority

   Challenge-response authentication
          An[2766] authentication system in which one player generates
          a[2767] random number, encrypts it and sends the result as a
          challenge. The other player decrypts and sends back the result.
          If the result is correct, that proves to the first player that
          the second player knew the appropriate secret, required for the
          decryption. Variations on this technique exist using[2768]
          public key or[2769] symmetric cryptography. Some provide
          two-way authentication, assuring each player of the other's
          identity.

          This is more secure than passwords against two simple attacks:

          + If cleartext passwords are sent across the wire (e.g. for
            telnet), an eavesdropper can grab them. The attacker may even
            be able to break into other systems if the user has chosen
            the same password for them.
          + If an encrypted password is sent, an attacker can record the
            encrypted form and use it later. This is called a replay
            attack.

          A challenge-response system never sends a password, either
          cleartext or encrypted. An attacker cannot record the response
          to one challenge and use it as a response to a later challenge.
          The random number is different each time.

          Of course an attacker might still try to break the
          cryptographic algorithm used, or the[2770] random number
          generator.

   Cipher Modes
          Different ways of using a block cipher when encrypting multiple
          blocks.

          Four standard modes were defined for[2771] DES in[2772] FIPS
          81. They can actually be applied with any block cipher.

   [2773]ECB Electronic CodeBook encrypt each block independently
   [2774]CBC Cipher Block Chaining
   XOR previous block ciphertext into new block plaintext before
   encrypting new block
   CFB Cipher FeedBack
   OFB Output FeedBack

          [2775]IPsec uses[2776] CBC mode since this is only marginally
          slower than[2777] ECB and is more secure. In ECB mode the same
          plaintext always encrypts to the same ciphertext, unless the
          key is changed. In CBC mode, this does not occur.

          Various other modes are also possible, but none of them are
          used in IPsec.

   Ciphertext
          The encrypted output of a cipher, as opposed to the
          unencrypted[2778] plaintext input.

   [2779]Cisco
          A vendor of routers, hubs and related products. Their IPsec
          products interoperate with Linux FreeS/WAN; see our[2780]
          interop section.

   Client
          This term has at least two distinct uses in discussing IPsec:

          + The clients of an IPsec gateway are the machines it protects,
            typically on one or more subnets behind the gateway. In this
            usage, all the machines on an office network are clients of
            that office's IPsec gateway. Laptop or home machines
            connecting to the office, however, are not clients of that
            gateway. They are remote gateways, running the other end of
            an IPsec connection. Each of them is also its own client.
          + IPsec client software is used to describe software which runs
            on various standalone machines to let them connect to IPsec
            networks. In this usage, a laptop or home machine connecting
            to the office is a client, and the office gateway is the
            server.

          We generally use the term in the first sense. Vendors of
          Windows IPsec solutions often use it in the second. See
          this[2781] discussion.

   Denial of service (DoS) attack
          An attack that aims at denying some service to legitimate users
          of a system, rather than providing a service to the attacker.

          + One variant is a flooding attack, overwhelming the system
            with too many packets, to much email, or whatever.
          + A closely related variant is a resource exhaustion attack.
            For example, consider a "TCP SYN flood" attack. Setting up a
            TCP connection involves a three-packet exchange:
               o Initiator: Connection please (SYN)
               o Responder: OK (ACK)
               o Initiator: OK here too
            If the attacker puts bogus source information in the first
            packet, such that the second is never delivered, the
            responder may wait a long time for the third to come back. If
            responder has already allocated memory for the connection
            data structures, and if many of these bogus packets arrive,
            the responder may run out of memory.
          + Another variant is to feed the system undigestible data,
            hoping to make it sick. For example, IP packets are limited
            in size to 64K bytes and a fragment carries information on
            where it starts within that 64K and how long it is. The "ping
            of death" delivers fragments that say, for example, that they
            start at 60K and are 20K long. Attempting to re-assemble
            these without checking for overflow can be fatal.

          The two example attacks discussed were both quite effective
          when first discovered, capable of crashing or disabling many
          operating systems. They were also well-publicised, and today
          far fewer systems are vulnerable to them.

   DES
          The Data Encryption Standard, a[2792] block cipher with 64-bit
          blocks and a 56-bit key. Probably the most widely used[2793]
          symmetric cipher ever devised. DES has been a US government
          standard for their own use (only for unclassified data), and
          for some regulated industries such as banking, since the late
          70's. It is now being replaced by[2794] AES .

          [2795]DES is seriously insecure against current attacks.

          [2796]Linux FreeS/WAN does not include DES, even though the
          RFCs specify it. We strongly recommend that single DES not be
          used.

          See also[2797] 3DES and[2798] DESX, stronger ciphers based on
          DES.

   DESX
          An improved[2799] DES suggested by Ron Rivest of RSA Data
          Security. It XORs extra key material into the text before and
          after applying the DES cipher.

          This is not required by the[2800] IPsec RFCs and not currently
          used in[2801] Linux FreeS/WAN. DESX would be the easiest
          additional transform to add; there would be very little code to
          write. It would be much faster than 3DES and almost certainly
          more secure than DES. However, since it is not in the RFCs
          other IPsec implementations cannot be expected to have it.

   DH

   DHCP
          Dynamic Host C onfiguration Protocol, a method of
          assigning[2803] dynamic IP addresses, and providing additional
          information such as addresses of DNS servers and of gateways.
          See this[2804] DHCP resource page.

   Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange protocol
          A protocol that allows two parties without any initial shared
          secret to create one in a manner immune to eavesdropping. Once
          they have done this, they can communicate privately by using
          that shared secret as a key for a block cipher or as the basis
          for key exchange.

          The protocol is secure against all[2805] passive attacks , but
          it is not at all resistant to active[2806] man-in-the-middle
          attacks. If a third party can impersonate Bob to Alice and vice
          versa, then no useful secret can be created. Authentication of
          the participants is a prerequisite for safe Diffie-Hellman key
          exchange. IPsec can use any of several[2807] authentication
          mechanisims. Those supported by FreeS/WAN are discussed in
          our[2808] configuration section.

          The Diffie-Hellman key exchange is based on the[2809] discrete
          logarithm problem and is secure unless someone finds an
          efficient solution to that problem.

          Given a prime p and generator g (explained under[2810] discrete
          log below), Alice:

          + generates a random number a
          + calculates A = g^a modulo p
          + sends A to Bob

          Meanwhile Bob:

          + generates a random number b
          + calculates B = g^b modulo p
          + sends B to Alice

          Now Alice and Bob can both calculate the shared secret s =
          g^(ab). Alice knows a and B, so she calculates s = B^a. Bob
          knows A and b so he calculates s = A^b.

          An eavesdropper will know p and g since these are made public,
          and can intercept A and B but, short of solving the[2811]
          discrete log problem, these do not let him or her discover the
          secret s.

   Digital signature
          Sender:

          + calculates a[2812] message digest of a document
          + encrypts the digest with his or her private key, using
            some[2813] public key cryptosystem.
          + attaches the encrypted digest to the document as a signature

          Receiver:

          + calculates a digest of the document (not including the
            signature)
          + decrypts the signature with the signer's public key
          + verifies that the two results are identical

          If the public-key system is secure and the verification
          succeeds, then the receiver knows

          + that the document was not altered between signing and
            verification
          + that the signer had access to the private key

          Such an encrypted message digest can be treated as a signature
          since it cannot be created without both the document and the
          private key which only the sender should possess. The[2814]
          legal issues are complex, but several countries are moving in
          the direction of legal recognition for digital signatures.

   discrete logarithm problem
          The problem of finding logarithms in a finite field. Given a
          field defintion (such definitions always include some operation
          analogous to multiplication) and two numbers, a base and a
          target, find the power which the base must be raised to in
          order to yield the target.

          The discrete log problem is the basis of several cryptographic
          systems, including the[2815] Diffie-Hellman key exchange used
          in the[2816] IKE protocol. The useful property is that
          exponentiation is relatively easy but the inverse operation,
          finding the logarithm, is hard. The cryptosystems are designed
          so that the user does only easy operations (exponentiation in
          the field) but an attacker must solve the hard problem
          (discrete log) to crack the system.

          There are several variants of the problem for different types
          of field. The IKE/Oakley key determination protocol uses two
          variants, either over a field modulo a prime or over a field
          defined by an elliptic curve. We give an example modulo a prime
          below. For the elliptic curve version, consult an advanced text
          such as[2817] Handbook of Applied Cryptography.

          Given a prime p, a generator g for the field modulo that prime,
          and a number x in the field, the problem is to find y such that
          g^y = x.

          For example, let p = 13. The field is then the integers from 0
          to 12. Any integer equals one of these modulo 13. That is, the
          remainder when any integer is divided by 13 must be one of
          these.

          2 is a generator for this field. That is, the powers of two
          modulo 13 run through all the non-zero numbers in the field.
          Modulo 13 we have:

          y      x
        2^0  ==  1
        2^1  ==  2
        2^2  ==  4
        2^3  ==  8
        2^4  ==  3 that is, the remainder from 16/13 is 3
        2^5  ==  6          the remainder from 32/13 is 6
        2^6  == 12 and so on
        2^7  == 11
        2^8  ==  9
        2^9  ==  5
        2^10 == 10
        2^11 ==  7
        2^12 ==  1

          Exponentiation in such a field is not difficult. Given, say, y
          = 11,calculating x = 7is straightforward. One method is just to
          calculate 2^11 = 2048,then 2048 mod 13 == 7.When the field is
          modulo a large prime (say a few 100 digits) you need a silghtly
          cleverer method and even that is moderately expensive in
          computer time, but the calculation is still not problematic in
          any basic way.

          The discrete log problem is the reverse. In our example, given
          x = 7,find the logarithm y = 11.When the field is modulo a
          large prime (or is based on a suitable elliptic curve), this is
          indeed problematic. No solution method that is not
          catastrophically expensive is known. Quite a few mathematicians
          have tackled this problem. No efficient method has been found
          and mathematicians do not expect that one will be. It seems
          likely no efficient solution to either of the main variants the
          discrete log problem exists.

          Note, however, that no-one has proven such methods do not
          exist. If a solution to either variant were found, the security
          of any crypto system using that variant would be destroyed.
          This is one reason[2818] IKE supports two variants. If one is
          broken, we can switch to the other.

   discretionary access control
          access control mechanisms controlled by the user, for example
          Unix rwx file permissions. These contrast with[2819] mandatory
          access controls.

   DNS
          Domain Name Service, a distributed database through which names
          are associated with numeric addresses and other information in
          the Internet Protocol Suite. See also the[2820] DNS background
          section of our documentation.

   dynamic IP address
          an IP address which is automatically assigned, either by[2822]
          DHCP or by some protocol such as[2823] PPP or[2824] PPPoE which
          the machine uses to connect to the Internet. This is the
          opposite of a[2825] static IP address, pre-set on the machine
          itself.

   ECB mode
          Electronic CodeBook mode, the simplest way to use a block
          cipher. See[2828] Cipher Modes.

   EDE
          The sequence of operations normally used in either the
          three-key variant of[2829] triple DES used in[2830] IPsec or
          the[2831] two-key variant used in some other systems.

          The sequence is:

          + Encrypt with key1
          + Decrypt with key2
          + Encrypt with key3

          For the two-key version, key1=key3.

          The "advantage" of this EDE order of operations is that it
          makes it simple to interoperate with older devices offering
          only single DES. Set key1=key2=key3 and you have the worst of
          both worlds, the overhead of triple DES with the "security" of
          single DES. Since both the[2832] security of single DES and the
          overheads of triple DES are seriously inferior to many other
          ciphers, this is a spectacularly dubious "advantage".

   Encryption
          Techniques for converting a readable message ([2839] plaintext)
          into apparently random material ([2840] ciphertext) which
          cannot be read if intercepted. A key is required to read the
          message.

          Major variants include[2841] symmetric encryption in which
          sender and receiver use the same secret key and[2842] public
          key methods in which the sender uses one of a matched pair of
          keys and the receiver uses the other. Many current systems,
          including[2843] IPsec, are[2844] hybrids combining the two
          techniques.

   ESP
          Encapsulated Security Payload, the[2845] IPsec protocol which
          provides[2846] encryption. It can also provide[2847]
          authentication service and may be used with null encryption
          (which we do not recommend). For details see our[2848] IPsec
          document and/or RFC 2406.

   Extruded subnet
          A situation in which something IP sees as one network is
          actually in two or more places.

          For example, the Internet may route all traffic for a
          particular company to that firm's corporate gateway. It then
          becomes the company's problem to get packets to various
          machines on their[2849] subnets in various departments. They
          may decide to treat a branch office like a subnet, giving it IP
          addresses "on" their corporate net. This becomes an extruded
          subnet.

          Packets bound for it are delivered to the corporate gateway,
          since as far as the outside world is concerned, that subnet is
          part of the corporate network. However, instead of going onto
          the corporate LAN (as they would for, say, the accounting
          department) they are then encapsulated and sent back onto the
          Internet for delivery to the branch office.

   H
   Hash
          see[2891] message digest

   Hashed Message Authentication Code (HMAC)
          using keyed[2892] message digest functions to authenticate a
          message. This differs from other uses of these functions:

          + In normal usage, the hash function's internal variable are
            initialised in some standard way. Anyone can reproduce the
            hash to check that the message has not been altered.
          + For HMAC usage, you initialise the internal variables from
            the key. Only someone with the key can reproduce the hash. A
            successful check of the hash indicates not only that the
            message is unchanged but also that the creator knew the key.

          The exact techniques used in[2893] IPsec are defined in RFC
          2104. They are referred to as HMAC-MD5-96 and HMAC-SHA-96
          because they output only 96 bits of the hash. This makes some
          attacks on the hash functions harder.

   Hybrid cryptosystem
          A system using both[2897] public key and[2898] symmetric cipher
          techniques. This works well. Public key methods provide key
          management and[2899] digital signature facilities which are not
          readily available using symmetric ciphers. The symmetric
          cipher, however, can do the bulk of the encryption work much
          more efficiently than public key methods.

   Initialisation Vector (IV)
          Some cipher[2939] modes, including the[2940] CBC mode which
          IPsec uses, require some extra data at the beginning. This data
          is called the initialisation vector. It need not be secret, but
          should be different for each message. Its function is to
          prevent messages which begin with the same text from encrypting
          to the same ciphertext. That might give an analyst an opening,
          so it is best prevented.

   Initiate-only opportunistic encryption (iOE)
          A form of[2941] opportunistic encryption (OE) in which a host

          records necessary to support incoming opportunistic connection
          requests. Common among hosts on cable or pppoe connections

   Linux
          A freely available Unix-like operating system based on a kernel
          originally written for the Intel 386 architecture by (then)
          student Linus Torvalds. Once his 32-bit kernel was available,
          the[2957] GNU utilities made it a usable system and
          contributions from many others led to explosive growth.

          Today Linux is a complete Unix replacement available for

          FreeS/WAN is intended to interoperate with other[2963] IPsec

          from the[2964] S/WAN multi-vendor IPsec compatability effort.
          Linux FreeS/WAN has two major components,[2965] KLIPS (KerneL

   Linux Security Modules (LSM)
          a project to create an interface in the Linux kernel that
          supports plug-in modules for various security policies.

          This allows multiple security projects to take different
          approaches to security enhancement without tying the kernel
          down to one particular approach. As I understand the history,
          several projects were pressing Linus to incorporate their
          changes, the various sets of changes were incompatible, and his
          answer was more-or-less "a plague on all your houses; I'll give
          you an interface, but I won't incorporate anything".

          It seems to be working. There is a fairly active[2970] LSM
          mailing list, and several projects are already using the
          interface.

          The[2972] Linux FreeS/WAN project has several public email

   Man-in-the-middle attack
          An[2974] active attack in which the attacker impersonates each
          of the legitimate players in a protocol to the other.

          For example, if[2975] Alice and Bob are negotiating a key via
          the[2976] Diffie-Hellman key agreement, and are not using[2977]
          authentication to be certain they are talking to each other,
          then an attacker able to insert himself in the communication
          path can deceive both players.

          Call the attacker Mallory. For Bob, he pretends to be Alice.
          For Alice, he pretends to be Bob. Two keys are then negotiated,
          Alice-to-Mallory and Bob-to-Mallory. Alice and Bob each think
          the key they have is Alice-to-Bob.

          A message from Alice to Bob then goes to Mallory who decrypts
          it, reads it and/or saves a copy, re-encrypts using the
          Bob-to-Mallory key and sends it along to Bob. Bob decrypts
          successfully and sends a reply which Mallory decrypts, reads,
          re-encrypts and forwards to Alice.

          To make this attack effective, Mallory must

          + subvert some part of the network in some way that lets him
            carry out the deception
            possible targets: DNS, router, Alice or Bob's machine, mail
            server, ...
          + beat any authentication mechanism Alice and Bob use
            strong authentication defeats the attack entirely; this is
            why[2978] IKE requires authentication
          + work in real time, delivering messages without introducing a
            delay large enough to alert the victims
            not hard if Alice and Bob are using email; quite difficult in
            some situations.

          If he manages it, however, it is devastating. He not only gets
          to read all the messages; he can alter messages, inject his
          own, forge anything he likes, . . . In fact, he controls the
          communication completely.

   mandatory access control
          access control mechanisims which are not settable by the user
          (see[2979] discretionary access control), but are enforced by
          the system.

          For example, a document labelled "secret, zebra" might be
          readable only by someone with secret clearance working on
          Project Zebra. Ideally, the system will prevent any transfer
          outside those boundaries. For example, even if you can read it,
          you should not be able to e-mail it (unless the recipient is
          appropriately cleared) or print it (unless certain printers are
          authorised for that classification).

          Mandatory access control is a required feature for some levels
          of[2980] Rainbow Book or[2981] Common Criteria classification,
          but has not been widely used outside the military and
          government. There is a good discussion of the issues in
          Anderson's[2982] Security Engineering.

          The[2983] Security Enhanced Linux project is adding mandatory
          access control to Linux.

   Manual keying
          An IPsec mode in which the keys are provided by the
          administrator. In FreeS/WAN, they are stored in
          /etc/ipsec.conf. The alternative,[2984] automatic keying, is
          preferred in most cases. See this[2985] discussion.

   MD4
          [2986]Message Digest Algorithm Four from Ron Rivest of[2987]
          RSA. MD4 was widely used a few years ago, but is now considered
          obsolete. It has been replaced by its descendants[2988] MD5
          and[2989] SHA.

   MD5
          [2990]Message Digest Algorithm Five from Ron Rivest of[2991]
          RSA, an improved variant of his[2992] MD4. Like MD4, it
          produces a 128-bit hash. For details see RFC 1321.

          MD5 is one of two message digest algorithms available in IPsec.
          The other is[2993] SHA. SHA produces a longer hash and is
          therefore more resistant to[2994] birthday attacks, but this is
          not a concern for IPsec. The[2995] HMAC method used in IPsec is
          secure even if the underlying hash is not particularly strong
          against this attack.

          Hans Dobbertin found a weakness in MD5, and people often ask
          whether this means MD5 is unsafe for IPsec. It doesn't. The
          IPsec RFCs discuss Dobbertin's attack and conclude that it does
          not affect MD5 as used for HMAC in IPsec.

   Meet-in-the-middle attack
          A divide-and-conquer attack which breaks a cipher into two
          parts, works against each separately, and compares results.
          Probably the best known example is an attack on double DES.
          This applies in principle to any pair of block ciphers, e.g. to
          an encryption system using, say, CAST-128 and Blowfish, but we
          will describe it for double DES.

          Double DES encryption and decryption can be written:

        C = E(k2,E(k1,P))
        P = D(k1,D(k2,C))

          Where C is ciphertext, P is plaintext, E is encryption, D is
          decryption, k1 is one key, and k2 is the other key. If we know
          a P, C pair, we can try and find the keys with a brute force
          attack, trying all possible k1, k2 pairs. Since each key is 56
          bits, there are 2^ 112 such pairs and this attack is painfully
          inefficient.

          The meet-in-the middle attack re-writes the equations to
          calculate a middle value M:

        M = E(k1,P)
        M = D(k2,C)

          Now we can try some large number of D(k2,C) decryptions with
          various values of k2 and store the results in a table. Then
          start doing E(k1,P) encryptions, checking each result to see if
          it is in the table.

          With enough table space, this breaks double DES with 2^56 +
          2^56 = 2^57work. Against triple DES, you need 2^56 + 2^112 ~=
          2^112.

          The memory requirements for such attacks can be prohibitive,
          but there is a whole body of research literature on methods of
          reducing them.

   Message Digest Algorithm
          An algorithm which takes a message as input and produces a hash
          or digest of it, a fixed-length set of bits which depend on the
          message contents in some highly complex manner. Design criteria
          include making it extremely difficult for anyone to counterfeit
          a digest or to change a message without altering its digest.
          One essential property is[2996] collision resistance. The main
          applications are in message[2997] authentication and[2998]
          digital signature schemes. Widely used algorithms include[2999]
          MD5 and[3000] SHA. In IPsec, message digests are used for[3001]
          HMAC authentication of packets.

   MTU
          Maximum Transmission U nit, the largest size of packet that can
          be sent over a link. This is determined by the underlying
          network, but must be taken account of at the IP level.

          IP packets, which can be up to 64K bytes each, must be packaged
          into lower-level packets of the appropriate size for the
          underlying network(s) and re-assembled on the other end. When a
          packet must pass over multiple networks, each with its own MTU,
          and many of the MTUs are unknown to the sender, this becomes a
          fairly complex problem. See[3002] path MTU discovery for
          details.

          Often the MTU is a few hundred bytes on serial links and 1500
          on Ethernet. There are, however, serial link protocols which
          use a larger MTU to avoid fragmentation at the ethernet/serial
          boundary, and newer (especially gigabit) Ethernet networks
          sometimes support much larger packets because these are more
          efficient in some applications.

   NAI
          [3003]Network Associates, a conglomerate formed from[3004] PGP
          Inc., TIS (Trusted Information Systems, a firewall vendor) and

   Nonce

   Non-routable IP address
          An IP address not normally allowed in the "to" or "from" IP
          address field header of IP packets.

          Almost invariably, the phrase "non-routable address" means one
          of the addresses reserved by RFC 1918 for private networks:

          + 10.anything
          + 172.x.anything with 16 <= x <= 31
          + 192.168.anything

          These addresses are commonly used on private networks, e.g.
          behind a Linux machines doing[3012] IP masquerade. Machines
          within the private network can address each other with these
          addresses. All packets going outside that network, however,
          have these addresses replaced before they reach the Internet.

          If any packets using these addresses do leak out, they do not
          go far. Most routers automatically discard all such packets.

          Various other addresses -- the 127.0.0.0/8 block reserved for
          local use, 0.0.0.0, various broadcast and network addresses --
          cannot be routed over the Internet, but are not normally
          included in the meaning when the phrase "non-routable address"
          is used.

   O
   Oakley
          A key determination protocol, defined in RFC 2412.

   Oakley groups
          The groups used as the basis of[3017] Diffie-Hellman key
          exchange in the Oakley protocol, and in[3018] IKE. Four were
          defined in the original RFC, and a fifth has been[3019] added
          since.

          Linux FreeS/WAN currently supports the three groups based on
          finite fields modulo a prime (Groups 1, 2 and 5) and does not
          support the elliptic curve groups (3 and 4). For a description
          of the difference of the types, see[3020] discrete logarithms.

   One time pad
          A cipher in which the key is:

          + as long as the total set of messages to be enciphered
          + absolutely[3021] random
          + never re-used

          Given those three conditions, it can easily be proved that the
          cipher is perfectly secure, in the sense that an attacker with
          intercepted message in hand has no better chance of guessing
          the message than an attacker who has not intercepted the
          message and only knows the message length. No such proof exists
          for any other cipher.

          There are, however, several problems with this "perfect"
          cipher.

          First, it is wildly impractical for most applications. Key
          management is at best difficult, often completely impossible.

          Second, it is extremely fragile. Small changes which violate
          the conditions listed above do not just weaken the cipher
          liitle. Quite often they destroy its security completely.

          + Re-using the pad weakens the cipher to the point where it can
            be broken with pencil and paper. With a computer, the attack
            is trivially easy.
          + Using anything less than truly[3022] random numbers
            completely invalidates the security proof.
          + In particular, using computer-generated pseudo-random numbers
            may give an extremely weak cipher. It might also produce a
            good stream cipher, if the pseudo-random generator is both
            well-designed and properely seeded.

          Marketing claims about the "unbreakable" security of various
          products which somewhat resemble one-time pads are common. Such
          claims are one of the surest signs of cryptographic[3023] snake
          oil; most systems marketed with such claims are worthless.

          Finally, even if the system is implemented and used correctly,
          it is highly vulnerable to a substitution attack. If an
          attacker knows some plaintext and has an intercepted message,
          he can discover the pad.

          + This does not matter if the attacker is just a[3024] passive
            eavesdropper. It gives him no plaintext he didn't already
            know and we don't care that he learns a pad which we will
            never re-use.
          + However, an[3025] active attacker who knows the plaintext can
            recover the pad, then use it to encode with whatever he
            chooses. If he can get his version delivered instead of
            yours, this may be a disaster. If you send "attack at dawn",
            the delivered message can be anything the same length --
            perhaps "retreat to east" or "shoot generals".
          + An active attacker with only a reasonable guess at the
            plaintext can try the same attack. If the guess is correct,
            this works and the attacker's bogus message is delivered. If
            the guess is wrong, a garbled message is delivered.

          In general then, despite its theoretical perfection, the
          one-time-pad has very limited practical application.

          See also the[3026] one time pad FAQ.

   Opportunistic encryption (OE)
          A situation in which any two IPsec-aware machines can secure
          their communications, without a pre-shared secret and without a
          common[3027] PKI or previous exchange of public keys. This is
          one of the goals of the Linux FreeS/WAN project, discussed in
          our[3028] introduction section.

          Setting up for opportunistic encryption is described in
          our[3029] quickstart document.

   Opportunistic responder
          A host which accepts, but does not initiate, requests for[3030]
          opportunistic encryption (OE). An opportunistic responder has
          enabled OE in its[3031] passive form (pOE) only. A web server
          or file server may be usefully set up as an opportunistic
          responder.

          Configuring passive OE is described in our[3032] policy groups
          document.

   Passive attack
          An attack in which the attacker only eavesdrops and attempts to
          analyse intercepted messages, as opposed to an[3037] active
          attack in which he diverts messages or generates his own.

   Passive opportunistic encryption (pOE)
          A form of[3038] opportunistic encryption (OE) in which the host
          will accept opportunistic connection requests, but will not
          initiate such requests. A host which runs OE in its passive
          form only is known as an[3039] opportunistic responder.

          Configuring passive OE is described in our[3040] policy groups
          document.

   Path MTU discovery
          The process of discovering the largest packet size which all
          links on a path can handle without fragmentation -- that is,
          without any router having to break the packet up into smaller
          pieces to match the[3041] MTU of its outgoing link.

          This is done as follows:

          + originator sends the largest packets allowed by[3042] MTU of
            the first link, setting the DF (don't f ragment) bit in the
            packet header
          + any router which cannot send the packet on (outgoing MTU is
            too small for it, and DF prevents fragmenting it to match)
            sends back an[3043] ICMP packet reporting the problem
          + originator looks at ICMP message and tries a smaller size
          + eventually, you settle on a size that can pass all routers
          + thereafter, originator just sends that size and no-one has to
            fragment

          Since this requires co-operation of many systems, and since the
          next packet may travel a different path, this is one of the
          trickier areas of IP programming. Bugs that have shown up over
          the years have included:

          + malformed ICMP messages
          + hosts that ignore or mishandle these ICMP messages
          + firewalls blocking the ICMP messages so host does not see
            them

          Since IPsec adds a header, it increases packet size and may
          require fragmentation even where incoming and outgoing MTU are
          equal.

   Perfect forward secrecy (PFS)
          A property of systems such as[3044] Diffie-Hellman key exchange
          which use a long-term key (such as the shared secret in IKE)
          and generate short-term keys as required. If an attacker who
          acquires the long-term key provably can

          + neither read previous messages which he may have archived
          + nor read future messages without performing additional
            successful attacks

          then the system has PFS. The attacker needs the short-term keys
          in order to read the trafiic and merely having the long-term
          key does not allow him to infer those. Of course, it may allow
          him to conduct another attack (such as[3045] man-in-the-middle)
          which gives him some short-term keys, but he does not
          automatically get them just by acquiring the long-term key.

   PGP
          Pretty Good Privacy, a personal encryption system for email
          based on public key technology, written by Phil Zimmerman.

          The 2.xx versions of PGP used the[3047] RSA public key
          algorithm and used[3048] IDEA as the symmetric cipher. These
          versions are described in RFC 1991 and in[3049] Garfinkel's
          book. Since version 5, the products from[3050] PGP Inc. have
          used[3051] Diffie-Hellman public key methods and[3052] CAST-128
          symmetric encryption. These can verify signatures from the 2.xx
          versions, but cannot exchange encryted messages with them.

          An[3053] IETF working group has issued RFC 2440 for an "Open
          PGP" standard, similar to the 5.x versions. PGP Inc. staff were
          among the authors. A free[3054] Gnu Privacy Guard based on that
          standard is now available.

          For more information on PGP, including how to obtain it, see
          our cryptography[3055] links.

   PGP Inc.
          A company founded by Zimmerman, the author of[3056] PGP , now a
          division of[3057] NAI. See the[3058] corporate website.
          Zimmerman left in 2001, and early in 2002 NAI announced that
          they would no longer sell PGP..

          Versions 6.5 and later of the PGP product include PGPnet, an
          IPsec client for Macintosh or for Windows 95/98/NT. See
          our[3059] interoperation document.

   Photuris
          Another key negotiation protocol, an alternative to[3060] IKE,
          described in RFCs 2522 and 2523.

   PPP
          Point-to-Point Protocol, originally a method of connecting over
          modems or serial lines, but see also PPPoE.

   PPPoE
          PPP over Ethernet, a somewhat odd protocol that makes Ethernet
          look like a point-to-point serial link. It is widely used for
          cable or ADSL Internet services, apparently mainly because it
          lets the providers use access control and address assignmment
          mechanisms developed for dialup networks.[3061] Roaring Penguin
          provide a widely used Linux implementation.

   PPTP
          Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol, used in some Microsoft VPN
          implementations. Papers discussing weaknesses in it are
          on[3062] counterpane.com. It is now largely obsolete, replaced
          by L2TP.

   PKI
          Public Key Infrastructure, the things an organisation or
          community needs to set up in order to make[3063] public key
          cryptographic technology a standard part of their operating
          procedures.

          There are several PKI products on the market. Typically they
          use a hierarchy of[3064] Certification Authorities (CAs). Often
          they use[3065] LDAP access to[3066] X.509 directories to
          implement this.

          See[3067] Web of Trust for a different sort of infrastructure.

   PKIX
          PKI eXchange, an[3068] IETF standard that allows[3069] PKIs to
          talk to each other.

          This is required, for example, when users of a corporate PKI
          need to communicate with people at client, supplier or
          government organisations, any of which may have a different PKI
          in place. I should be able to talk to you securely whenever:

          + your organisation and mine each have a PKI in place
          + you and I are each set up to use those PKIs
          + the two PKIs speak PKIX
          + the configuration allows the conversation

          At time of writing (March 1999), this is not yet widely
          implemented but is under quite active development by several
          groups.

   Plaintext
          The unencrypted input to a cipher, as opposed to the
          encrypted[3070] ciphertext output.

   Pluto
          The[3071] Linux FreeS/WAN daemon which handles key exchange via
          the[3072] IKE protocol, connection negotiation, and other
          higher-level tasks. Pluto calls the[3073] KLIPS kernel code as
          required. For details, see the manual page ipsec_pluto(8).

   Public Key Cryptography
          In public key cryptography, keys are created in matched pairs.
          Encrypt with one half of a pair and only the matching other
          half can decrypt it. This contrasts with[3074] symmetric or
          secret key cryptography in which a single key known to both
          parties is used for both encryption and decryption.

          One half of each pair, called the public key, is made public.
          The other half, called the private key, is kept secret.
          Messages can then be sent by anyone who knows the public key to
          the holder of the private key. Encrypt with the public key and
          you know that only someone with the matching private key can
          decrypt.

          Public key techniques can be used to create[3075] digital
          signatures and to deal with key management issues, perhaps the
          hardest part of effective deployment of[3076] symmetric
          ciphers. The resulting[3077] hybrid cryptosystems use public
          key methods to manage keys for symmetric ciphers.

          Many organisations are currently creating[3078] PKIs, public
          key infrastructures to make these benefits widely available.

   Q
   R
   Rainbow books
          A set of US government standards for evaluation of "trusted
          computer systems", of which the best known was the[3080] Orange
          Book . One fairly often hears references to "C2 security" or a
          product "evaluated at B1". The Rainbow books define the
          standards referred to in those comments.

          See this[3081] reference page.

          The Rainbow books are now mainly obsolete, replaced by the
          international[3082] Common Criteria standards.

   Random
          A remarkably tricky term, far too much so for me to attempt a
          definition here. Quite a few cryptosystems have been broken via
          attacks on weak random number generators, even when the rest of
          the system was sound.

          See[3083] RFC 1750 for the theory.

          See the manual pages for[3084] ipsec_ranbits(8) and
          ipsec_prng(3) for more on FreeS/WAN's use of randomness. Both
          depend on the random(4) device driver..

          A couple of years ago, there was extensive mailing list
          discussion (archived[3085] here )of Linux /dev/random and
          FreeS/WAN. Since then, the design of the random(4) driver has
          changed considerably. Linux 2.4 kernels have the new driver..

   Raptor
          A firewall product for Windows NT offerring IPsec-based VPN
          services. Linux FreeS/WAN interoperates with Raptor; see
          our[3086] interop document for details. Raptor have recently
          merged with Axent.

   RC4
          Rivest Cipher four, designed by Ron Rivest of[3087] RSA and
          widely used. Believed highly secure with adequate key length,
          but often implemented with inadequate key length to comply with
          export restrictions.

   RC6
          Rivest Cipher six,[3088] RSA's[3089] AES candidate cipher.

   Replay attack
          An attack in which the attacker records data and later replays
          it in an attempt to deceive the recipient.

   Reverse map
          In[3090] DNS, a table where IP addresses can be used as the key
          for lookups which return a system name and/or other
          information.

   RFC
          Request For Comments, an Internet document. Some RFCs are just
          informative. Others are standards.

          Our list of[3091] IPsec and other security-related RFCs
          is[3092] here, along with information on methods of obtaining
          them.

   Rijndael
          a[3093] block cipher designed by two Belgian cryptographers,
          winner of the US government's[3094] AES contest to pick a
          replacement for[3095] DES. See the[3096] Rijndael home page.

   RIPEMD
          A[3097] message digest algorithm. The current version is
          RIPEMD-160 which gives a 160-bit hash.

   Root CA
          The top level[3098] Certification Authority in a hierachy of
          such authorities.

   Routable IP address
          Most IP addresses can be used as "to" and "from" addresses in
          packet headers. These are the routable addresses; we expect
          routing to be possible for them. If we send a packet to one of
          them, we expect (in most cases; there are various
          complications) that it will be delivered if the address is in
          use and will cause an[3099] ICMP error packet to come back to
          us if not.

          There are also several classes of[3100] non-routable IP
          addresses.

   RSA algorithm
          Rivest Shamir Adleman[3101] public key algorithm, named for its
          three inventors. It is widely used and likely to become moreso
          since it became free of patent encumbrances in September 2000.

          RSA can be used to provide either[3102] encryption or[3103]
          digital signatures. In IPsec, it is used only for signatures.
          These provide gateway-to-gateway[3104] authentication for[3105]
          IKE negotiations.

          For a full explanation of the algorithm, consult one of the
          standard references such as[3106] Applied Cryptography. A
          simple explanation is:

          The great 17th century French mathematician[3107] Fermat proved
          that,

          for any prime p and number x, 0 <= x < p:

        x^p == x         modulo p
        x^(p-1) == 1     modulo p, non-zero x


          From this it follows that if we have a pair of primes p, q and
          two numbers e, d such that:

        ed == 1          modulo lcm( p-1, q-1)


          where lcm() is least common multiple, then
          for all x, 0 <= x < pq:

      x^ed == x           modulo pq


          So we construct such as set of numbers p, q, e, d and publish
          the product N=pq and e as the public key. Using c for[3108]
          ciphertext and i for the input[3109] plaintext, encryption is
          then:

        c = i^e           modulo N


          An attacker cannot deduce i from the cyphertext c, short of
          either factoring N or solving the[3110] discrete logarithm
          problem for this field. If p, q are large primes (hundreds or
          thousands of bits) no efficient solution to either problem is
          known.

          The receiver, knowing the private key (N and d), can readily
          recover the plaintext p since:

        c^d == (i^e)^d    modulo N
            == i^ed       modulo N
            == i          modulo N


          This gives an effective public key technique, with only a
          couple of problems. It uses a good deal of computer time, since
          calculations with large integers are not cheap, and there is no
          proof it is necessarily secure since no-one has proven either
          factoring or discrete log cannot be done efficiently. Quite a
          few good mathematicians have tried both problems, and no-one
          has announced success, but there is no proof they are
          insoluble.

          A company founded by the inventors of the[3111] RSA public key
          algorithm.

   S
   SA
          Security Association, the channel negotiated by the higher
          levels of an[3112] IPsec implementation ([3113] IKE) and used
          by the lower ([3114]ESP and[3115] AH). SAs are unidirectional;
          you need a pair of them for two-way communication.

          An SA is defined by three things -- the destination, the
          protocol ([3116] AH or[3117]ESP) and the[3118] SPI, security
          parameters index. It is used as an index to look up other
          things such as session keys and intialisation vectors.

          For more detail, see our section on[3119] IPsec and/or RFC
          2401.

   SE Linux
          Security Enhanced Linux, an[3120] NSA-funded project to
          add[3121] mandatory access control to Linux. See the[3122]
          project home page.

          According to their web pages, this work will include extending
          mandatory access controls to IPsec tunnels.

          Recent versions of SE Linux code use the[3123] Linux Security
          Module interface.

   Secure DNS
          A version of the[3124] DNS or Domain Name Service enhanced with
          authentication services. This is being designed by the[3125]
          IETF DNS security[3126] working group. Check the[3127] Internet
          Software Consortium for information on implementation progress
          and for the latest version of[3128] BIND. Another site
          has[3129] more information .

          [3130]IPsec can use this plus[3131] Diffie-Hellman key exchange
          to bootstrap itself. This allows[3132] opportunistic
          encryption. Any pair of machines which can authenticate each
          other via DNS can communicate securely, without either a
          pre-existing shared secret or a shared[3133] PKI.

   Sequence number
          A number added to a packet or message which indicates its
          position in a sequence of packets or messages. This provides
          some security against[3137] replay attacks.

          For[3138] automatic keying mode, the[3139] IPsec RFCs require
          that the sender generate sequence numbers for each packet, but
          leave it optional whether the receiver does anything with them.

   SHA
   SHA-1
          Secure Hash Algorithm, a[3140] message digest algorithm
          developed by the[3141] NSA for use in the Digital Signature
          standard,[3142] FIPS number 186 from[3143] NIST. SHA is an
          improved variant of[3144] MD4 producing a 160-bit hash.

          SHA is one of two message digest algorithms available in IPsec.
          The other is[3145] MD5. Some people do not trust SHA because it
          was developed by the[3146] NSA. There is, as far as we know, no
          cryptographic evidence that SHA is untrustworthy, but this does
          not prevent that view from being strongly held.

          The NSA made one small change after the release of the original
          SHA. They did not give reasons. Iit may be a defense against
          some attack they found and do not wish to disclose. Technically
          the modified algorithm should be called SHA-1, but since it has
          replaced the original algorithm in nearly all applications, it
          is generally just referred to as SHA..

   SHA-256
   SHA-384
   SHA-512
          Newer variants of SHA designed to match the strength of the
          128, 192 and 256-bit keys of[3147] AES. The work to break an
          encryption algorithm's strength by[3148] brute force is 2
          keylength operations but a[3149] birthday attack on a hash
          needs only 2 hashlength / 2 , so as a general rule you need a
          hash twice the size of the key to get similar strength.
          SHA-256, SHA-384 and SHA-512 are designed to match the 128, 192
          and 256-bit key sizes of AES, respectively.

   Signals intelligence (SIGINT)
          Activities of government agencies from various nations aimed at
          protecting their own communications and reading those of
          others. Cryptography, cryptanalysis, wiretapping, interception
          and monitoring of various sorts of signals. The players include
          the American[3150] NSA, British[3151] GCHQ and Canadian[3152]
          CSE.

   SPI
          Security Parameter Index, an index used within[3157] IPsec to
          keep connections distinct. A[3158] Security Association (SA) is
          defined by destination, protocol and SPI. Without the SPI, two
          connections to the same gateway using the same protocol could
          not be distinguished.

          For more detail, see our[3159] IPsec section and/or RFC 2401.

   SSH
          Secure SHell, an encrypting replacement for the insecure
          Berkeley commands whose names begin with "r" for "remote": rsh,
          rlogin, etc.

          For more information on SSH, including how to obtain it, see
          our cryptography[3160] links.

   SSH Communications Security
          A company founded by the authors of[3161] SSH. Offices are
          in[3162] Finland and[3163] California. They have a toolkit for
          developers of IPsec applications.

   SSL
          [3164]Secure Sockets Layer , a set of encryption and
          authentication services for web browsers, developed by
          Netscape. Widely used in Internet commerce. Also known as[3165]
          TLS.

   SSLeay
          A free implementation of[3166] SSL by Eric Young (eay) and
          others. Developed in Australia; not subject to US export
          controls.

   static IP address
          an IP adddress which is pre-set on the machine itself, as
          opposed to a[3167] dynamic address which is assigned by a[3168]
          DHCP server or obtained as part of the process of establishing
          a[3169] PPP or[3170] PPPoE connection

   Stream cipher
          A[3171] symmetric cipher which produces a stream of output
          which can be combined (often using XOR or bytewise addition)
          with the plaintext to produce ciphertext. Contrasts with[3172]
          block cipher.

          [3173]IPsec does not use stream ciphers. Their main application
          is link-level encryption, for example of voice, video or data
          streams on a wire or a radio signal.

   subnet
          A group of IP addresses which are logically one network,
          typically (but not always) assigned to a group of physically
          connected machines. The range of addresses in a subnet is
          described using a subnet mask. See next entry.

   subnet mask
          A method of indicating the addresses included in a subnet. Here
          are two equivalent examples:

          + 101.101.101.0/24
          + 101.101.101.0 with mask 255.255.255.0

          The '24' is shorthand for a mask with the top 24 bits one and
          the rest zero. This is exactly the same as 255.255.255.0 which
          has three all-ones bytes and one all-zeros byte.

          These indicate that, for this range of addresses, the top 24
          bits are to be treated as naming a network (often referred to
          as "the 101.101.101.0/24 subnet") while most combinations of
          the low 8 bits can be used to designate machines on that
          network. Two addresses are reserved; 101.101.101.0 refers to
          the subnet rather than a specific machine while 101.101.101.255
          is a broadcast address. 1 to 254 are available for machines.

          It is common to find subnets arranged in a hierarchy. For
          example, a large company might have a /16 subnet and allocate
          /24 subnets within that to departments. An ISP might have a
          large subnet and allocate /26 subnets (64 addresses, 62 usable)
          to business customers and /29 subnets (8 addresses, 6 usable)
          to residential clients.

   S/WAN
          Secure Wide Area Network, a project involving[3174] RSA Data
          Security and a number of other companies. The goal was to
          ensure that all their[3175] IPsec implementations would
          interoperate so that their customers can communicate with each
          other securely.

   Symmetric cryptography
          Symmetric cryptography, also referred to as conventional or
          secret key cryptography, relies on a shared secret key,
          identical for sender and receiver. Sender encrypts with that
          key, receiver decrypts with it. The idea is that an
          eavesdropper without the key be unable to read the messages.
          There are two main types of symmetric cipher,[3176] block
          ciphers and[3177] stream ciphers.

          Symmetric cryptography contrasts with[3178] public key or
          asymmetric systems where the two players use different keys.

          The great difficulty in symmetric cryptography is, of course,
          key management. Sender and receiver must have identical keys
          and those keys must be kept secret from everyone else. Not too
          much of a problem if only two people are involved and they can
          conveniently meet privately or employ a trusted courier. Quite
          a problem, though, in other circumstances.

          It gets much worse if there are many people. An application
          might be written to use only one key for communication among
          100 people, for example, but there would be serious problems.
          Do you actually trust all of them that much? Do they trust each
          other that much? Should they? What is at risk if that key is
          compromised? How are you going to distribute that key to
          everyone without risking its secrecy? What do you do when one
          of them leaves the company? Will you even know?

          On the other hand, if you need unique keys for every possible
          connection between a group of 100, then each user must have 99
          keys. You need either 99*100/2 = 4950 secure key exchanges
          between users or a central authority that securely distributes
          100 key packets, each with a different set of 99 keys.

          Either of these is possible, though tricky, for 100 users.
          Either becomes an administrative nightmare for larger numbers.
          Moreover, keys must be changed regularly, so the problem of key
          distribution comes up again and again. If you use the same key
          for many messages then an attacker has more text to work with
          in an attempt to crack that key. Moreover, one successful crack
          will give him or her the text of all those messages.

          In short, the hardest part of conventional cryptography is key
          management. Today the standard solution is to build a[3179]
          hybrid system using[3180] public key techniques to manage keys.

   T
   TIS
          Trusted Information Systems, a firewall vendor now part
          of[3181] NAI. Their Gauntlet product offers IPsec VPN services.
          TIS implemented the first version of[3182] Secure DNS on
          a[3183] DARPA contract.

   TLS
          Transport Layer Security, a newer name for[3184] SSL.

   TOS field
          The Type Of S ervice field in an IP header, used to control
          qualkity of service routing.

   Traffic analysis
          Deducing useful intelligence from patterns of message traffic,
          without breaking codes or reading the messages. In one case
          during World War II, the British guessed an attack was coming
          because all German radio traffic stopped. The "radio silence"
          order, intended to preserve security, actually gave the game
          away.

          In an industrial espionage situation, one might deduce
          something interesting just by knowing that company A and
          company B were talking, especially if one were able to tell
          which departments were involved, or if one already knew that A
          was looking for acquisitions and B was seeking funds for
          expansion.

          In general, traffic analysis by itself is not very useful.
          However, in the context of a larger intelligence effort where
          quite a bit is already known, it can be very useful. When you
          are solving a complex puzzle, every little bit helps.

          [3185]IPsec itself does not defend against traffic analysis,
          but carefully thought out systems using IPsec can provide at
          least partial protection. In particular, one might want to
          encrypt more traffic than was strictly necessary, route things
          in odd ways, or even encrypt dummy packets, to confuse the
          analyst. We discuss this[3186] here.

   Transport mode
          An IPsec application in which the IPsec gateway is the
          destination of the protected packets, a machine acts as its own
          gateway. Contrast with[3187] tunnel mode.

   Triple DES
          see[3188] 3DES

   TTL
          Time To Live, used to control[3189] DNS caching. Servers
          discard cached records whose TTL expires

   Tunnel mode
          An IPsec application in which an IPsec gateway provides
          protection for packets to and from other systems. Contrast
          with[3190] transport mode.

   Two-key Triple DES
          A variant of[3191] triple DES or 3DES in which only two keys
          are used. As in the three-key version, the order of operations
          is[3192] EDE or encrypt-decrypt-encrypt, but in the two-key
          variant the first and third keys are the same.

          3DES with three keys has 3*56 = 168 bits of key but has only
          112-bit strength against a[3193] meet-in-the-middle attack, so
          it is possible that the two key version is just as strong. Last
          I looked, this was an open question in the research literature.

          RFC 2451 defines triple DES for[3194] IPsec as the three-key
          variant. The two-key variant should not be used and is not
          implemented directly in[3195] Linux FreeS/WAN. It cannot be
          used in automatically keyed mode without major fiddles in the
          source code. For manually keyed connections, you could make
          Linux FreeS/WAN talk to a two-key implementation by setting two
          keys the same in /etc/ipsec.conf.

   U
   V
   Virtual Interface
          A[3196] Linux feature which allows one physical network
          interface to have two or more IP addresses. See the Linux
          Network Administrator's Guide in[3197] book form or[3198] on
          the web for details.

   Virtual Private Network
          see[3199] VPN

   VPN
          Virtual Private Network, a network which can safely be used as
          if it were private, even though some of its communication uses
          insecure connections. All traffic on those connections is
          encrypted.

          [3200]IPsec is not the only technique available for building
          VPNs, but it is the only method defined by[3201] RFCs and
          supported by many vendors. VPNs are by no means the only thing
          you can do with IPsec, but they may be the most important
          application for many users.

   VPNC
          [3202]Virtual Private Network Consortium , an association of
          vendors of VPN products.

   W
   Wassenaar Arrangement
          An international agreement restricting export of munitions and
          other tools of war. Unfortunately, cryptographic software is
          also restricted under the current version of the
          agreement.[3203] Discussion.

   Web of Trust
          [3204]PGP's method of certifying keys. Any user can sign a key;
          you decide which signatures or combinations of signatures to
          accept as certification. This contrasts with the hierarchy
          of[3205] CAs (Certification Authorities) used in many[3206]
          PKIs (Public Key Infrastructures).

          See[3207] Global Trust Register for an interesting addition to
          the web of trust.

   WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy)
          The cryptographic part of the[3208] IEEE standard for wireless
          LANs. As the name suggests, this is designed to be only as
          secure as a normal wired ethernet. Anyone with a network
          conection can tap it. Its advocates would claim this is good
          design, refusing to build in complex features beyond the actual
          requirements.

          Critics refer to WEP as "Wiretap Equivalent Privacy", and
          consider it a horribly flawed design based on bogus
          "requirements". You do not control radio waves as you might
          control your wires, so the metaphor in the rationale is utterly
          inapplicable. A security policy that chooses not to invest
          resources in protecting against certain attacks which can only
          be conducted by people physically plugged into your LAN may or
          may not be reasonable. The same policy is completely
          unreasonable when someone can "plug in" from a laptop half a
          block away..

          There has been considerable analysis indicating that WEP is
          seriously flawed. A FAQ on attacks against WEP is available.
          Part of it reads:

     ... attacks are practical to mount using only inexpensive
     off-the-shelf equipment. We recommend that anyone using an 802.11
     wireless network not rely on WEP for security, and employ other
     security measures to protect their wireless network. Note that our
     attacks apply to both 40-bit and the so-called 128-bit versions of
     WEP equally well.

          WEP appears to be yet another instance of governments, and
          unfortunately some vendors and standards bodies, deliberately
          promoting hopelessly flawed "security" products, apparently
          mainly for the benefit of eavesdropping agencies. See
          this[3209] discussion .

   X
   X.509
          A standard from the[3210] ITU (International Telecommunication
          Union), for hierarchical directories with authentication
          services, used in many[3211] PKI implementations.

          Use of X.509 services, via the[3212] LDAP protocol, for
          certification of keys is allowed but not required by the[3213]
          IPsec RFCs. It is not yet implemented in[3214] Linux FreeS/WAN.

   Xedia
          A vendor of router and Internet access products, now part of
          Lucent. Their QVPN products interoperate with Linux FreeS/WAN;
          see our[3215] interop document.

   2nd edition, O'Reilly 1999 ISBN: 1-56592-529-7

   This is the only O'Reilly book, out of a dozen I own, that I'm

   proprietary tools --[3242] PPTP,[3243] SSH, Cisco PIX, ... -- and
   touches only lightly on IPsec-based approaches.

   That said, it appears to deal competently with what it does cover and
   it has readable explanations of many basic VPN and security concepts.
   It may be exactly what some readers require, even if I find the
   emphasis unfortunate.

The RFCs.tar.gz Distribution File

   The Linux FreeS/WAN distribution is available from[3247] our primary
   distribution site and various mirror sites. To give people more
   control over their downloads, the RFCs that define IP security are
   bundled separately in the file RFCs.tar.gz.

   The file you are reading is included in the main distribution and is
   available on the web site. It describes the RFCs included in the[3248]
   RFCs.tar.gz bundle and gives some pointers to[3249] other ways to get
   them.

Other sources for RFCs & Internet drafts

  RFCs

   RFCs are downloadble at many places around the net such as:

     * [3254]Connected Internet Encyclopedia

   and some of them are available in translation:
     * [3255]French

   There is also a published[3256] Big Book of IPSEC RFCs.

  Internet Drafts

   Internet Drafts, working documents which sometimes evolve into RFCs,
   are also available.

   Some things used by[3262] IPsec, such as[3263] DES and[3264] SHA, are
   defined by US government standards called[3265] FIPS. The issuing
   organisation,[3266] NIST, have a[3267] FIPS home page.

             Distribution Roadmap: What's Where in Linux FreeS/WAN

   This file is a guide to the locations of files within the FreeS/WAN
   distribution. Everything described here should be on your system once
   you download, gunzip, and untar the distribution.

   This distribution contains two major subsystems

   [3268]KLIPS
          the kernel code

   [3269]Pluto
          the user-level key-management daemon

   plus assorted odds and ends.

Top directory

   The top directory has essential information in text files:

   README
          introduction to the software

   INSTALL
          short experts-only installation procedures. More detalied
          procedures are in[3270] installation and[3271] configuration
          HTML documents.

   BUGS
          major known bugs in the current release.

   CHANGES
          changes from previous releases

   CREDITS
          acknowledgement of contributors

   COPYING
          licensing and distribution information

Documentation

   The doc directory contains the bulk of the documentation, most of it
   in HTML format. See the[3272] index file for details.

KLIPS: kernel IP security

   [3273]KLIPS is KerneL IP Security. It lives in the klips directory, of
   course.

   klips/doc
          documentation

   klips/patches
          patches for existing kernel files

   klips/test
          test stuff

   klips/utils
          low-level user utilities

   klips/net/ipsec
          actual klips kernel files

   klips/src
          symbolic link to klips/net/ipsec

          The "make insert" step of installation installs the patches and
          makes a symbolic link from the kernel tree to klips/net/ipsec.
          The odd name of klips/net/ipsec is dictated by some annoying
          limitations of the scripts which build the Linux kernel. The
          symbolic-link business is a bit messy, but all the alternatives
          are worse.

   klips/utils
          Utility programs:

        eroute
                manipulate IPsec extended routing tables

        klipsdebug
                set Klips (kernel IPsec support) debug features and level

        spi
                manage IPsec Security Associations

        spigrp
                group/ungroup IPsec Security Associations

        tncfg
                associate IPsec virtual interface with real interface

          These are all normally invoked by ipsec(8) with commands such
          as

        ipsec tncfg arguments

          There are section 8 man pages for all of these; the names have
          "ipsec_" as a prefix, so your man command should be something
          like:

        man 8 ipsec_tncfg

Pluto key and connection management daemon

   [3274]Pluto is our key management and negotiation daemon. It lives in
   the pluto directory, along with its low-level user utility, whack.

   There are no subdirectories. Documentation is a man page,[3275]
   pluto.8. This covers whack as well.

Utils

   The utils directory contains a growing collection of higher-level user
   utilities, the commands that administer and control the software. Most
   of the things that you will actually have to run yourself are in
   there.

   ipsec
          invoke IPsec utilities

          ipsec(8) is normally the only program installed in a standard
          directory, /usr/local/sbin. It is used to invoke the others,
          both those listed below and the ones in klips/utils mentioned
          above.

   auto
          control automatically-keyed IPsec connections

   manual
          take manually-keyed IPsec connections up and down

   barf
          generate copious debugging output

   look
          generate moderate amounts of debugging output

   There are .8 manual pages for these. look is covered in barf.8. The
   man pages have an "ipsec_" prefix so your man command should be
   something like:
        man 8 ipsec_auto

   Examples are in various files with names utils/*.eg

Libraries

  FreeS/WAN Library

   The lib directory is the FreeS/WAN library, also steadily growing,
   used by both user-level and kernel code.
   It includes section 3[3276] man pages for the library routines.

  Imported Libraries

    LibDES

   The libdes library, originally from SSLeay, is used by both Klips and
   Pluto for[3277] Triple DES encryption. Single DES is not used
   because[3278] it is insecure.

   Note that this library has its own license, different from the[3279]
   GPL used for other code in FreeS/WAN.

   The library includes its own documentation.

    GMP

   The GMP (GNU multi-precision) library is used for multi-precision
   arithmetic in Pluto's key-exchange code and public key code.

   Older versions (up to 1.7) of FreeS/WAN included a copy of this
   library in the FreeS/WAN distribution.

   Since 1.8, we have begun to rely on the system copy of GMP.

                         User-Mode-Linux Testing guide

   User mode linux is a way to compile a linux kernel such that it can
   run as a process in another linux system (potentially as a *BSD or
   Windows process later). See[3280]
   http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net/

   UML is a good platform for testing and experimenting with FreeS/WAN.
   It allows several network nodes to be simulated on a single machine.
   Creating, configuring, installing, monitoring, and controling these
   nodes is generally easier and easier to script with UML than real
   hardware.

   You'll need about 500Mb of disk space for a full
   sunrise-east-west-sunset setup. You can possibly get this down by
   130Mb if you remove the sunrise/sunset kernel build. If you just want
   to run, then you can even remove the east/west kernel build.

   Nothing need be done as super user. In a couple of steps, we note
   where super user is required to install commands in system-wide
   directories, but ~/bin could be used instead. UML seems to use a
   system-wide /tmp/uml directory so different users may interfere with
   one another. Later UMLs use ~/.uml instead, so multiple users running
   UML tests should not be a problem, but note that a single user running
   the UML tests will only be able run one set. Further, UMLs sometimes
   get stuck and hang around. These "zombies" (most will actually be in
   the "T" state in the process table) will interfere with subsequent
   tests.

Preliminary Notes on BIND

   As of 2003/3/1, the Light-Weight Resolver is used by pluto. This
   requires that BIND9 be running. It also requires that BIND9
   development libraries be present in the build environment. The DNSSEC
   code is only truly functional in BIND9 snapshots. The library code
   could be 9.2.2, we believe. We are using BIND9 20021115 snapshot code
   from[3281] ftp://ftp.isc.org/isc/bind9/snapshots.

   FreeS/WAN may well require a newer BIND than is on your system. Many
   distributions have moved to BIND9.2.2 recently due to a security
   advisory. BIND is five components.
    1. named
    2. dnssec-*
    3. client side resolver libraries
    4. client side utility libraries I thought there were lib and named
       parts to dnsssec...
    5. dynamic DNS update utilities

   The only piece that we need for *building* is #4. That's the only part
   that has to be on the build host. What is the difference between
   resolver and util libs? If you want to edit
   testing/baseconfigs/all/etc/bind, you'll need a snapshot version. The
   resolver library contains the resolver. FreeS/WAN has its own copy of
   that in lib/liblwres.

Steps to Install UML for FreeS/WAN

    1. Get the following files:
         a. from[3282] http://www.sandelman.ottawa.on.ca/freeswan/uml/
            umlfreeroot-15.1.tar.gz (or highest numbered one). This is a
            debian potato root file system. You can use this even on a
            Redhat host, as it has the newer GLIBC2.2 libraries as well.
         b. From[3283] ftp://ftp.xs4all.nl/pub/crypto/freeswan/ a
            snapshot or release (1.92 or better)
         c. From a[3284] http://www.kernel.org mirror, the virgin 2.4.19
            kernel. Please realize that we have defaults in our tree for
            kernel configuration. We try to track the latest UML kernels.
            If you use a newer kernel, you may have faults in the kernel
            build process. You can see what the latest that is being
            regularly tested by visiting[3285] freeswan-regress-env.sh.
         d. Get[3286] http://ftp.nl.linux.org/uml/
            uml-patch-2.4.19-47.bz2 or the one associated with your
            kernel. As of 2003/03/05, uml-patch-2.4.19-47.bz2 works for
            us. More recent versions of the patch have not been tested by
            us.
         e. You'll probably want to visit[3287]
            http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net and get the UML
            utilities. These are not needed for the build or interactive
            use (but recommended). They are necessary for the regression
            testing procedures used by "make check". We currently use
            uml_utilities_20020212.tar.bz2.
         f. You need tcpdump version 3.7.1 or better. This is newer than
            the version included in most LINUX distributions. You can
            check the version of an installed tcpdump with the --version
            flag. If you need a newer tcpdump fetch both tcpdump and
            libpcap source tar files from[3288] http://www.tcpdump.org/
            or a mirror.
    2. Pick a suitable place, and extract the following files:
         a. 2.4.19 kernel. For instance:
            cd /c2/kernel
           tar xzvf ../download/pub/linux/kernel/v2.4/linux-2.4.19.tar.gz

         b. extract the umlfreeroot file
            mkdir -p /c2/user-mode-linux/basic-root
           cd /c2/user-mode-linux/basic-root
           tar xzvf ../download/umlfreeroot-15.1.tar.gz

         c. FreeSWAN itself (or checkout "all" from CVS)
            mkdir -p /c2/freeswan/sandbox
           cd /c2/freeswan/sandbox
           tar xzvf ../download/snapshot.tar.gz

    3. If you need to build a newer tcpdump:
          + Make sure you have OpenSSL installed -- it is needed for
            cryptographic routines.
          + Unpack libpcap and tcpdump source in parallel directories
            (the tcpdump build procedures look for libpcap next door).
          + Change directory into the libpcap source directory and then
            build the library:
        ./configure
        make

          + Change into the tcpdump source directory, build tcpdump, and
            install it.
        ./configure
        make
        # Need to be superuser to install in system directories.
        # Installing in ~/bin would be an alternative.
        su -c "make install"

    4. If you need the uml utilities, unpack them somewhere then build
       and install them:
        cd tools
        make all
        # Need to be superuser to install in system directories.
        # Installing in ~/bin would be an alternative.
        su -c "make install BIN_DIR=/usr/local/bin"

    5. set up the configuration file
          + cd /c2/freeswan/sandbox/freeswan-1.97/testing/utils
          + copy umlsetup-sample.sh to ../../umlsetup.sh: cp
            umlsetup-sample.sh ../../umlsetup.sh
          + open up ../../umlsetup.sh in your favorite editor.
          + change POOLSPACE= to point to the place with at least 500Mb
            of disk. Best if it is on the same partition as the
            "umlfreeroot" extraction, as it will attempt to use hard
            links if possible to save disk space.
          + Set TESTINGROOT if you intend to run the script outside of
            the sandbox/snapshot/release directory. Otherwise, it will
            configure itself.
          + KERNPOOL should point to the directory with your 2.4.19
            kernel tree. This tree should be unconfigured! This is the
            directory you used in step 2a.
          + UMLPATCH should point at the bz2 file you downloaded at 1d.
            If using a kernel that already includes the patch, set this
            to /dev/null.
          + FREESWANDIR should point at the directory where you unpacked
            the snapshot/release. Include the "freeswan-snap2001sep16b"
            or whatever in it. If you are running from CVS, then you
            point at the directory where top, klips, etc. are. The script
            will fix up the directory so that it can be used.
          + BASICROOT should be set to the directory used in 2b, or to
            the directory that you created with RPMs.
          + SHAREDIR should be set to the directory used in 2c, to
            /usr/share for Debian potato users, or to
            $BASICROOT/usr/share.
    6.
 cd $TESTINGROOT/utils
sh make-uml.sh
       It will grind for awhile. If there are errors it will bail. If so,
       run it under "script" and send the output to
       bugs@lists.freeswan.org.
    7. You will have a bunch of stuff under $POOLSPACE. Open four xterms:
     for i in sunrise sunset east west
    do
        xterm -name $i -title $i -e $POOLSPACE/$i/start.sh &    done
    8. Login as root. Password is "root" (Note, these virtual machines
       are networked together, but are not configured to talk to the rest
       of the world.)
    9. verify that pluto started on east/west, run "ipsec look"
   10. login to sunrise. run "ping sunset"
   11. login to west. run "tcpdump -p -i eth1 -n" (tcpdump must be
       version 3.7.1 or newer)
   12. Closing a console xterm will shut down that UML.
   13. You can "make check", if you want to. It is run from
       /c2/freeswan/sandbox/freeswan-1.97.

                         Debugging the kernel with GDB

   With User-Mode-Linux, you can debug the kernel using GDB. See
   http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net/debugging.html.

   Typically, one will want to address a test case for a failing
   situation. Running GDB from Emacs, or from other front ends is
   possible. First start GDB.

   Tell it to open the UMLPOOL/swan/linux program.

   Note the PID of GDB:
marajade-[projects/freeswan/mgmt/planning] mcr 1029 %ps ax | grep gdb
 1659 pts/9    SN     0:00 /usr/bin/gdb -fullname -cd /mara4/freeswan/kernpatch
/UMLPOOL/swan/ linux

   Set the following in the environment:
UML_east_OPT="debug gdb-pid=1659"

   Then start the user-mode-linux in the test scheme you wish:
marajade-[kernpatch/testing/klips/east-icmp-02] mcr 1220 %../../utils/runme.sh

   The user-mode-linux will stop on boot, giving you a chance to attach
   to the process:
(gdb) file linux
Reading symbols from linux...done.
(gdb) attach 1
Attaching to program: /mara4/freeswan/kernpatch/UMLPOOL/swan/linux, process 1
0xa0118bc1 in kill () at hostfs_kern.c:770

   At this point, break points should be created as appropriate.

Other notes about debugging

   If you are running a standard test, after all the packets are sent,
   the UML will be shutdown. This can cause problems, because the UML may
   get terminated while you are debugging.

   The environment variable NETJIGWAITUSER can be set to "waituser". If
   so, then the testing system will prompt before exiting the test.

                           User-Mode-Linux mysteries

     * running more than one UML of the same name (e.g. "west") can cause
       problems.
     * running more than one UML from the same root file system is not a
       good idea.
     * all this means that running "make check" twice on the same machine
       is probably not a good idea.
     * occationally, UMLs will get stuck. This can happen like: 15134 ? T
       0:00 /spare/hugh/uml/uml2.4.18-sept5/umlbuild/east/linux (east)
       [/bin/sh] 15138 ? T 0:00
       /spare/hugh/uml/uml2.4.18-sept5/umlbuild/east/linux (east) [halt]
       these will need to be killed. Note that they are in "T"racing
       mode.
     * UMLs can also hang, and will report "Tracing myself and I can't
       get out". This is a bug in UML. There are ways to find out what is
       going on and report this to the UML people, but we don't know the
       magic right now.

                       Getting more info from uml_netjig

   uml_netjig can be compiled with a built-in tcpdump. This uses
   not-yet-released code from[3289] www.tcpdump.org. Please see the
   instructions in testing/utils/uml_netjig/Makefile.

                     How to configure to use "make check"

What is "make check"

   "make check" is a target in the top level makefile. It takes care of
   running a number of unit and system tests to confirm that FreeSWAN has
   been compiled correctly, and that no new bugs have been introduced.

   As FreeSWAN contains both kernel and userspace components, doing
   testing of FreeSWAN requires that the kernel be simulated. This is
   typically difficult to do as a kernel requires that it be run on bare
   hardware. A technology has emerged that makes this simpler. This
   is[3290] User Mode Linux.

   User-Mode Linux is a way to build a Linux kernel such that it can run
   as a process under another Linux (or in the future other) kernel.
   Presently, this can only be done for 2.4 guest kernels. The host
   kernel can be 2.2 or 2.4.

   "make check" expects to be able to build User-Mode Linux kernels with
   FreeSWAN included. To do this it needs to have some files downloaded
   and extracted prior to running "make check". This is described in
   the[3291] UML testing document.

   After having run the example in the UML testing document and
   successfully brought up the four machine combination, you are ready to
   use "make check"

Running "make check"

   "make check" works by walking the FreeSWAN source tree invoking the
   "check" target at each node. At present there are tests defined only
   for the klips directory. These tests will use the UML infrastructure
   to test out pieces of the klips code.

   The results of the tests can be recorded. If the environment variable
   $REGRESSRESULTS is non-null, then the results of each test will be
   recorded. This can be used as part of a nightly regression testing
   system, see[3292] Nightly testing for more details.

   "make check" otherwise prints a minimal amount of output for each
   test, and indicates pass/fail status of each test as they are run.
   Failed tests do not cause failure of the target in the form of exit
   codes.

                       How to write a "make check" test

Structure of a test

   Each test consists of a set of directories under testing/ . There are
   directories for klips, pluto, packaging and libraries. Each directory
   has a list of tests to run is stored in a file called TESTLIST in that
   directory. e.g. testing/klips/TESTLIST.

The TESTLIST

   This isn't actually a shell script. It just looks like one. Some tools
   other than /bin/sh process it. Lines that start with # are comments.
# test-kind     directory-containing-test       expectation     [PR#]

   The first word provides the test type, detailed below.

   The second word is the name of the test to run. This the directory in
   which the test case is to be found..

   The third word may be one of:

   blank/good
          the test is believed to function, report failure

   bad
          the test is known to fail, report unexpected success

   suspended
          the test should not be run

   The fourth word may be a number, which is a PR# if the test is
   failing.

Test kinds

   The test types are:

   skiptest
          means run no test.

   ctltest
          means run a single system without input/output.

   klipstest
          means run a single system with input/output networks

   [3293]umlplutotest
          means run a pair of systems

   [3294]umlXhost
          run an arbitrary number of systems

   suntest (TBD)

          means run a trio of east-sunrise + warrior

   extrudedtest (TBD)
          means run a quad of east-sunrise + warriorsouth + park

   mkinsttest
          a test of the "make install" machinery.

   kernel_test_patch
          a test of the "make kernelpatch" machinery.

   Tests marked (TBD) have yet to be fully defined.

   Each test directory has a file in it called testparams.sh . This file
   sets a number of environment variables to define the parameters of the
   test.

Common parameters

   TESTNAME
          the name of the test (repeated for checking purposes)

   TEST_TYPE
          the type of the test (repeat of type type above)

   TESTHOST
          the name of the UML machine to run for the test, typically
          "east" or "west"

   TEST_PURPOSE
          The purpose of the test is one of:

        goal
                The goal purpose is where a test is defined for code that
                is not yet finished. The test indicates when the goals
                have in fact been reached.

        regress
                This is a test to determine that a previously existing
                bug has been repaired. This test will initially be
                created to reproduce the bug in isolation, and then the
                bug will be fixed.

        exploit
                This is a set of packets/programs that causes a
                vulnerability to be exposed. It is a specific variation
                of the regress option.

   TEST_GOAL_ITEM
          in the case of a goal test, this is a reference to the
          requirements document

   TEST_PROB_REPORT
          in the case of regression test, this the problem report number
          from GNATS

   TEST_EXPLOIT_URL
          in the case of an exploit, this is a URL referencing the paper
          explaining the origin of the test and the origin of exploit
          software

   REF_CONSOLE_OUTPUT
          a file in the test directory that contains the sanitized
          console output against which to compare the output of the
          actual test.

   REF_CONSOLE_FIXUPS
          a list of scripts (found in klips/test/fixups) to apply to
          sanitize the console output of the machine under test. These
          are typically perl, awk or sed scripts that remove things in
          the kernel output that change each time the test is run and/or
          compiled.

   INIT_SCRIPT
          a file of commands that is fed into the virtual machine's
          console in single user mode prior to starting the tests. This
          file will usually set up any eroute's and SADB entries that are
          required for the test.

          Lines beginning with # are skipped. Blank lines are skipped.
          Otherwise, a shell prompted is waited for each time (consisting
          of \n#) and then the command is sent. Note that the prompt is
          waited for before the command and not after, so completion of
          the last command in the script is not required. This is often
          used to invoke a program to monitor the system, e.g. ipsec
          pf_key.

   RUN_SCRIPT
          a file of commands that is fed into the virtual machine's
          console in single user mode, before the packets are sent. On
          single machine tests, this script doesn't provide any more
          power than INIT_SCRIPT, but is implemented for consistency's
          sake.

   FINAL_SCRIPT
          a file of commands that is fed into the virtual machine's
          console in single user mode after the final packet is sent.
          Similar to INIT_SCRIPT, above. If not specified, then the
          single command "halt" is sent. If specified, then the script
          should end with a halt command to nicely shutdown the UML.

   CONSOLEDIFFDEBUG
          If set to "true" then the series of console fixups (see
          REF_CONSOLE_FIXUPS) will be output after it is constructed. (It
          should be set to "false", or unset otherwise)

   NETJIGDEBUG
          If set to "true" then the series of console fixups (see
          REF_CONSOLE_FIXUPS) will be output after it is constructed. (It
          should be set to "false", or unset otherwise)

   NETJIGTESTDEBUG
          If set to "netjig", then the results of talking to the
          uml_netjig will be printed to stderr during the test. In
          addition, the jig will be invoked with --debug, which causes it
          to log its process ID, and wait 60 seconds before continuing.
          This can be used if you are trying to debug the uml_netjig
          program itself.

   HOSTTESTDEBUG
          If set to "hosttest", then the results of taling to the
          consoles of the UMLs will be printed to stderr during the test.

   NETJIGWAITUSER
          If set to "waituser", then the scripts will wait forever for
          user input before they shut the tests down. Use this is if you
          are debugging through the kernel.

   PACKETRATE
          A number, in miliseconds (default is 500ms) at which packets
          will be replayed by the netjig.

KLIPStest paramaters

   The klipstest function starts a program (
   testing/utils/uml_netjig/uml_netjig) to setup a bunch of I/O sockets
   (that simulate network interfaces). It then exports the references to
   these sockets to the environment and invokes (using system()) a given
   script. It waits for the script to finish.

   The script invoked (testing/utils/host-test.tcl) is a TCL[3295] expect
   script that arranges to start the UML and configure it appropriately
   for the test. The configuration is done with the script given above
   for INIT_SCRIPT . The TCL script then forks, leaves the UML in the
   background and exits. uml_netjig continues. It then starts listening
   to the simulated network answering ARPs and inserting packets as
   appropriate.

   The klipstest function invokes uml_netjig with arguments to capture
   output from network interface(s) and insert packets as appropriate:

   PUB_INPUT
          a[3296] pcap file to feed in on the public (encrypted)
          interface. (typically, eth1)

   PRIV_INPUT
          a pcap file to feed in on the private (plain-text) interface
          (typically, eth0).

   REF_PUB_OUTPUT
          a text file containing tcpdump output. Packets on the public
          (eth1) interface are captured to a[3297] pcap file by
          uml_netjig. The klipstest function then uses tcpdump on the
          file to produce text output, which is compared to the file
          given.

   REF_PUB_FILTER
          a program that will filter the TCPDUMP output to do further
          processing. Defaults to "cat".

   REF_PRIV_OUTPUT
          a text file containing tcpdump output. Packets on the private
          (eth0) interface are captured and compared after conversion by
          tcpdump, as with REFPUBOUTPUT.

   REF_PRIV_FILTER
          a program that will filter the TCPDUMP output to do further
          processing. Defaults to "cat".

   EXITONEMPTY
          a flag for uml_netjig. It should contain "--exitonempty" of
          uml_netjig should exit when all of the input (
          PUBINPUT,PRIVINPUT) packets have been injected.

   ARPREPLY
          a flag for uml_netjig. It should contain "--arpreply" if
          uml_netjig should reply to ARP requests. One will typically set
          this to avoid having to fudge the ARP cache manually.

   TCPDUMPFLAGS
          a set of flags for the tcpdump used when converting captured
          output. Typical values will include "-n" to turn off DNS, and
          often "-E" to set the decryption key (tcpdump 3.7.1 and higher
          only) for ESP packets. The "-t" flag (turn off timestamps) is
          provided automatically

   NETJIG_EXTRA
          additional comments to be sent to the netjig. This may arrange
          to record or create additional networks, or may toggle options.

mkinsttest paramaters

   The basic concept of the mkinsttest test type is that it performs a
   "make install" to a temporary $DESTDIR. The resulting tree can then be
   examined to determine if it was done properly. The files can be
   uninstalled to determine if the file list was correct, or the contents
   of files can be examined more precisely.

   INSTALL_FLAGS
          If set, then an install will be done. This provides the set of
          flags to provide for the install. The target to be used
          (usually "install") must be among the flags.

   POSTINSTALL_SCRIPT
          If set, a script to run after initial "make install". Two
          arguments are provided: an absolute path to the root of the
          FreeSWAN src tree, and an absolute path to the temporary
          installation area.

   INSTALL2_FLAGS
          If set, a second install will be done using these flags.
          Similarly to INSTALL_FLAGS, the target must be among the flags.

   UNINSTALL_FLAGS
          If set, an uninstall will be done using these flags. Similarly
          to INSTALL_FLAGS, the target (usually "uninstall") must be
          among the flags.

   REF_FIND_f_l_OUTPUT
          If set, a find $ROOT ( -type f -or -type -l ) will be done to
          get a list of a real files and symlinks. The resulting file
          will be compared to the file listed by this option.

   REF_FILE_CONTENTS
          If set, it should point to a file containing records for the
          form:



reffile

samplefile

          one record per line. A diff between the provided reference
          file, and the sample file (located in the temporary
          installation root) will be done for each record.

rpm_build_install_test paramaters

   The rpm_build_install_test type is to verify that the proper packing
   list is produced by "make rpm", and that the mechanisms for building
   the kernel modules produce consistent results.

   RPM_KERNEL_SOURCE
          Point to an extracted copy of the RedHat kernel source code.
          Variables from the environment may be used.

   REF_RPM_CONTENTS
          This is a file containing one record per line. Each record
          consists of a RPM name (may contain wildcards) and a filename
          to compare the contents to. The RPM will be located and a file
          list will be produced with rpm2cpio.

libtest paramaters

   The libtest test is for testing library routines. The library file is
   expected to provided an #ifdef by the name of library . The libtest
   type invokes the C compiler to compile this file, links it against
   libfreeswan.a (to resolve any other dependancies) and runs the test
   with the -r argument to invoke a regression test.

   The library test case is expected to do a self-test, exiting with
   status code 0 if everything is okay, and with non-zero otherwise. A
   core dump (exit code greater than 128) is noted specifically.

   Unlike other tests, there are no subdirectories required, or other
   parameters to set.

umlplutotest paramaters

   The umlplutotest function starts a pair of user mode line processes.
   This is a 2-host version of umlXhost. The "EAST" and "WEST" slots are
   defined.

umlXhost parameters

   The umlXtest function starts an arbitrary number of user mode line
   processes.

   The script invoked (testing/utils/Xhost-test.tcl) is a TCL[3298]
   expect script that arranges to start each UML and configure it
   appropriately for the test. It then starts listening (using
   uml_netjig) to the simulated network answering ARPs and inserting
   packets as appropriate.

   umlXtest has a series of slots, each of which should be filled by a
   host. The list of slots is controlled by the variable, XHOST_LIST.
   This variable should be set to a space seperated list of slots. The
   former umlplutotest is now implemented as a variation of the umlXhost
   test, with XHOST_LIST="EAST WEST".

   For each host slot that is defined, a series of variables should be
   filled in, defining what configuration scripts to use for that host.

   The following are used to control the console input and output to the
   system. Where the string ${host} is present, the host slot should be
   filled in. I.e. for the two host system with XHOST_LIST="EAST WEST",
   then the variables: EAST_INIT_SCRIPT and WEST_INIT_SCRIPT will exist.

   ${host}HOST
          The name of the UML host which will fill this slot

   ${host}_INIT_SCRIPT
          a file of commands that is fed into the virtual machine's
          console in single user mode prior to starting the tests. This
          file will usually set up any eroute's and SADB entries that are
          required for the test. Similar to INIT_SCRIPT, above.

   ${host}_RUN_SCRIPT
          a file of commands that is fed into the virtual machine's
          console in single user mode, before the packets are sent. This
          set of commands is run after all of the virtual machines are
          initialized. I.e. after EAST_INIT_SCRIPT AND WEST_INIT_SCRIPT.
          This script can therefore do things that require that all
          machines are properly configured.

   ${host}_RUN2_SCRIPT
          a file of commands that is fed into the virtual machine's
          console in single user mode, after the packets are sent. This
          set of commands is run before any of the virtual machines have
          been shut down. (I.e. before EAST_FINAL_SCRIPT AND
          WEST_FINAL_SCRIPT.) This script can therefore catch
          post-activity status reports.

   ${host}_FINAL_SCRIPT
          a file of commands that is fed into the virtual machine's
          console in single user mode after the final packet is sent.
          Similar to INIT_SCRIPT, above. If not specified, then the
          single command "halt" is sent. Note that when this script is
          run, the other virtual machines may already have been killed.
          If specified, then the script should end with a halt command to
          nicely shutdown the UML.

   REF_${host}_CONSOLE_OUTPUT
          Similar to REF_CONSOLE_OUTPUT, above.

   Some additional flags apply to all hosts:

   REF_CONSOLE_FIXUPS
          a list of scripts (found in klips/test/fixups) to apply to
          sanitize the console output of the machine under test. These
          are typically perl, awk or sed scripts that remove things in
          the kernel output that change each time the test is run and/or
          compiled.

   In addition to input to the console, the networks may have input fed
   to them:

   EAST_INPUT/WEST_INPUT
          a[3299] pcap file to feed in on the private network side of
          each network. The "EAST" and "WEST" here refer to the networks,
          not the hosts.

   REF_PUB_FILTER
          a program that will filter the TCPDUMP output to do further
          processing. Defaults to "cat".

   REF_EAST_FILTER/REF_WEST_FILTER
          a program that will filter the TCPDUMP output to do further
          processing. Defaults to "cat". <

   TCPDUMPFLAGS
          a set of flags for the tcpdump used when converting captured
          output. Typical values will include "-n" to turn off DNS, and
          often "-E" to set the decryption key (tcpdump 3.7.1 and higher
          only) for ESP packets. The "-t" flag (turn off timestamps) is
          provided automatically

   REF_EAST_OUTPUT/REF_WEST_OUTPUT
          a text file containing tcpdump output. Packets on the private
          (eth0) interface are captured and compared after conversion by
          tcpdump, as with REF_PUB_OUTPUT.

          There are two additional environment variables that may be set
          on the command line:

        NETJIGVERBOSE=verbose export NETJIGVERBOSE
                If set, then the test output will be "chatty", and let
                you know what commands it is running, and as packets are
                sent. Without it set, the output is limited to
                success/failure messages.

        NETJIGTESTDEBUG=netjig export NETJIGTESTDEBUG
                This will enable debugging of the communication with
                uml_netjig, and turn on debugging in this utility. This
                does not imply NETJIGVERBOSE.

   HOSTTESTDEBUG=hosttest export HOSTTESTDEBUG
          This will show all interactions with the user-mode-linux
          consoles

kernel_patch_test paramaters

   The kernel_patch_test function takes some kernel source, copies it
   with lndir, and then applies the patch as produced by "make
   kernelpatch".

   The following are used to control the input and output to the system:

   KERNEL_NAME
          the kernel name, typically something like "linus" or "rh"

   KERNEL_VERSION
          the kernel version number, as in "2.2" or "2.4".

   KERNEL_${KERNEL_NAME}${KERNEL_VERSION}_SRC
          This variable should set in the environment, probably in
          ~/freeswan-regress-env.sh. Examples of this variables would be
          KERNEL_LINUS2_0_SRC or KERNEL_RH7_3_SRC. This variable should
          point to an extracted copy of the kernel source in question.

   REF_PATCH_OUTPUT
          a copy of the patch output to compare against

   KERNEL_PATCH_LEAVE_SOURCE
          If set to a non-empty string, then the patched kernel source is
          not removed at the end of the test. This will typically be set
          in the environment while debugging.

module_compile paramaters

   The module_compile test attempts to build the KLIPS module against a
   given set of kernel source. This is also done by the RPM tests, but in
   a very specific manner.

   There are two variations of this test - one where the kernel either
   doesn't need to be configured, or is already done, and tests were
   there is a local configuration file.

   Where the kernel doesn't need to be configured, the kernel source that
   is found is simply used. It may be a RedHat-style kernel, where one
   can cause it to configure itself via rhconfig.h-style definitions. Or,
   it may just be a kernel tree that has been configured.

   If the variable KERNEL_CONFIG_FILE is set, then a new directory is
   created for the kernel source. It is populated with lndir(1). The
   referenced file is then copied in as .config, and "make oldconfig" is
   used to configure the kernel. This resulting kernel is then used as
   the reference source.

   In all cases, the kernel source is found the same was for the
   kernelpatch test, i.e. via KERNEL_VERSION/KERNEL_NAME and
   KERNEL_${KERNEL_NAME}${KERNEL_VERSION}_SRC.

   Once there is kernel source, the module is compiled using the
   top-level "make module" target.

   The test is considered successful if an executable is found in
   OUTPUT/module/ipsec.o at the end of the test.

   KERNEL_NAME
          the kernel name, typically something like "linus" or "rh"

   KERNEL_VERSION
          the kernel version number, as in "2.2" or "2.4".

   KERNEL_${KERNEL_NAME}${KERNEL_VERSION}_SRC
          This variable should set in the environment, probably in
          ~/freeswan-regress-env.sh. Examples of this variables would be
          KERNEL_LINUS2_0_SRC or KERNEL_RH7_3_SRC. This variable should
          point to an extracted copy of the kernel source in question.

   KERNEL_CONFIG_FILE
          The configuration file for the kernel.

   KERNEL_PATCH_LEAVE_SOURCE
          If set to a non-empty string, then the configured kernel source
          is not removed at the end of the test. This will typically be
          set in the environment while debugging.

   MODULE_DEF_INCLUDE
          The include file that will be used to configure the KLIPS
          module, and possibly the kernel source.

                               Current pitfalls

   "tcpdump dissector" not available.
          This is a non-fatal warning. If uml_netjig is invoked with the
          -t option, then it will attempt to use tcpdump's dissector to
          decode each packet that it processes. The dissector is
          presently not available, so this option it normally turned off
          at compile time. The dissector library will be released with
          tcpdump version 4.0.

                          Nightly regression testing

   The nightly regression testing system consists of several shell
   scripts and some perl scripts. The goal is to check out a fresh tree,
   run "make check" on it, record the results and summarize the results
   to the team and to the web site.

   Output can be found on[3300] adams , although the tests are actually
   run on another project machine.

                        How to setup the nightly build

   The best way to do nightly testing is to setup a new account. We call
   the account "build" - you could call it something else, but there may
   still be some references to ~build in the scripts.

Files you need to know about

   As few files as possible need to be extracted from the source tree -
   files are run from the source tree whenever possible. However, there
   are some bootstrap and configuration files that are necessary.

   There are 7 files in testing/utils that are involved:

   nightly-sample.sh
          This is the root of the build process. This file should be
          copied out of the CVS tree, to $HOME/bin/nightly.sh of the
          build account. This file should be invoked from cron.

   freeswan-regress-env-sample.sh
          This file should be copied to $HOME/freeswan-regress-env.sh. It
          should be edited to localize the values. See below.

   regress-cleanup.pl
          This file needs to be copied to $HOME/bin/regress-cleanup.pl.
          It is invoked by the nightly file before doing anything else.
          It removes previous nights builds in order to free up disk
          space for the build about to be done.

   teammail-sample.sh
          A script used to send results email to the "team". This sample
          script could be copied to $HOME/bin/teammail.sh. This version
          will PGP encrypt all the output to the team members. If this
          script is used, then PGP will have to be properly setup to have
          the right keys.

   regress-nightly.sh
          This is the first stage of the nightly build. This stage will
          call other scripts as appropriate, and will extract the source
          code from CVS. This script should be copied to
          $HOME/bin/regress-nightly.sh

   regress-stage2.sh
          This is the second stage of the nightly build. It is called in
          place. It essentially sets up the UML setup in umlsetup.sh, and
          calls "make check".

   regress-summarize-results.pl
          This script will summarize the results from the tests to a
          permanent directory set by $REGRESSRESULTS. It is invoked from
          the stage2 nightly script.

   regress-chart.sh
          This script is called at the end of the build process, and will
          summarize each night's results (as saved into $REGRESSRESULTS
          by regress-summarize-results.pl) as a chart using gnuplot. Note
          that this requires at least gnuplot 3.7.2.

Configuring freeswan-regress-env.sh

   For more info on KERNPOOL, UMLPATCH, BASICROOT and SHAREDIR, see[3301]
   User-Mode-Linux testing guide.

   KERNPOOL
          Extract copy of some kernel source to be used for UML builds

   UMLPATCH
          matching User-Mode-Linux patch.

   BASICROOT
          the root file system image (see[3302] User-Mode-Linux testing
          guide).

   SHAREDIR=${BASICROOT}/usr/share
          The /usr/share to use.

   REGRESSTREE
          A directory in which to store the nightly regression results.
          Directories will be created by date in this tree.

   TCPDUMP=tcpdump-3.7.1
          The path to the[3303] tcpdump to use. This must have crypto
          compiled in, and must be at least 3.7.1

   KERNEL_RH7_2_SRC=/a3/kernel_sources/linux-2.4.9-13/
          An extracted copy of the RedHat 7.2. kernel source. If set,
          then the packaging/rpm-rh72-install-01 test will be run, and an
          RPM will be built as a test.

   KERNEL_RH7_3_SRC=/a3/kernel_sources/rh/linux-2.4.18-5
          An extracted copy of the RedHat 7.3. kernel source. If set,
          then the packaging/rpm-rh73-install-01 test will be run, and an
          RPM will be built as a test.

   NIGHTLY_WATCHERS="userid,userid,userid"
          The list of people who should receive nightly output. This is
          used by teammail.sh

   FAILLINES=128
          How many lines of failed test output to include in the nightly
          output

   PATH=$PATH:/sandel/bin export PATH
          You can also override the path if necessary here.

   CVSROOT=:pserver:anoncvs@ip212.xs4net.freeswan.org:/freeswan/MASTER
          The CVSROOT to use. This example may work for anonymous CVS,
          but will be 12 hours behind the primary, and is still
          experimental

   SNAPSHOTSIGDIR=$HOME/snapshot-sig
          For the release tools, where to put the generated per-snapshot
          signature keys

   LASTREL=1.97
          the name of the last release branch (to find the right
          per-snapshot signature
