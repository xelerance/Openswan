1. Abstract

   [IKE] allows a device to set up a secure session by using a
   bidirectional authentication method using either pre-shared keys or
   digital certificates.  However [IKE] does not provide a method to
   leverage legacy authentication methods which are widely deployed
   today.

   This document describes a method for using existing unidirectional
   authentication mechanisms such as RADIUS, SecurID, and OTP within
   IPsec's ISAKMP protocol.  The purpose of this draft is not to
   replace or enhance the existing authentication mechanisms described
   in [IKE], but rather to allow them to be extended using legacy
   authentication mechanisms.

   This protocol is designed in such a way that extended authentication
   may be accomplished using any mode of operation for phase 1 (i.e.
   Main Mode or Aggressive Mode) as well as any authentication method
   supported by [IKE].  This protocol may also be easily extended to
   support new modes or authentication methods.  This protocol does
   however require that the phase 1 authentication method be fully
   secure.

   The authors currently intend this document to be published as an
   Informational RFC, not a standards-track document, so that the many
   IPsec implementations that have implemented to earlier drafts of
   this protocol can have a single stable reference.

   Comments regarding this draft should be sent to ietf-xauth@vpnc.org
   or to the authors.

3. Introduction

   The following technique allows IPsec's ISAKMP/Oakley [IKE] protocol
   to support extended authentication mechanisms like two-factor
   authentication, challenge/response and other remote access
   unidirectional authentication methods.

   These authentication mechanisms have a large deployment in remote
   access applications and many IT departments have requirements for
   these unidirectional authentication mechanisms.

   This draft defines packet formats for a protocol which allows you to
   carry legacy authentication information from one peer to another.
   It does so by extending the [IKECFG] protocol.  This protocol
   requires a sufficient level of security from the phase 1 SA
   authentication.

   This protocol may be used in conjunction with a multitude of
   combinations of modes (i.e. Main Mode, Aggressive Mode, etc) and
   authentication methods (i.e. Pre-Shared keys, RSA Signatures, DSS
   Signatures, etc).  This protocol has also been designed to work
   with any new modes and authentication methods.

   This draft also specifies how to accomplish legacy authentication
   when used with the existing modes and authentication methods defined
   in IKE (the assumption here being that they offer "sufficient" level
   of security to protect the XAUTH exchange).  This is accomplished by
   extending the [IKE] protocol.


   The document has been published as informational as the IPSRA
   working group will not accept any protocol which extends ISAKMP or
   IKE.  Furthermore, the IPsec working group refuses to accept any
   protocols that deal with remote access.

   At the time of the writing of this draft, the IPSRA working group
   has still not defined a protocol to solve the issue of legacy

   authentication.  XAUTH has been in existance for several years, and
   has successfully proven interoperability.  Several vendors have
   implemented and deployed the protocol.  Several vendors wish to
   implement the protocol but have had problems finding the protocol
   specification.  For this reason, the draft is being republished as
   informational to give new vendors an opportunity to interoperate
   with the many existing vendors who implement this protocol today.



3.1. Changes since last revision.

   The last revision of this document was published as "draft-beaulieu-
   ike-xauth-01.txt"

   o clarified text regarding CHALLENGE attribute
   o clarified text regarding NEXT-PIN attribute


3.2. Extended Authentication

   Two-factor authentication and challenge/response schemes like SDI's
   SecurID and RADIUS are forms of authentication that allow a gateway,
   firewall, or network access server to offload the user
   administration and authentication to a central management server.
   IPsec's ISAKMP/Oakley protocol supports certificates (RSA & DSS),
   shared-secret, and Kerberos as authentication methods, but since the
   authentication methods described within this document are only
   unidirectional authentication methods (client to a
   gateway/firewall), they cannot be used by themselves, but must be
   used in conjunction with the other standard ISAKMP authentication
   methods.

   The technique described within this document utilizes ISAKMP to
   transfer the user's authentication information (name, password) to
   the gateway/firewall (edge device) in a secured ISAKMP message. The
   edge device would then use the appropriate protocol (RADIUS,
   SecurID, OTP) to authenticate the user.  This allows the
   authentication server to be within the private network that the edge
   device is protecting.


3.3. Reader Prerequisites

   It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the terms and
   concepts described in the "Security Architecture for the Internet
   Protocol" [ArchSec] and "IP Security Document Roadmap" [Thayer97]
   documents.

   Readers are advised to be familiar with both [IKE] and [ISAKMP] as
   well as [IKECFG] since this document is an extension to that
   document.

4. Vendor ID

   XAUTH currently uses attribute numbers from the private ranges of
   both [IKE] and [IKECFG].  In order to ensure interoperability with
   future and past implementations of XAUTH a Vendor ID has been added.
   The Vendor ID payload is sent during the phase 1 exchange as per
   [ISAKMP].  The vendor id payload SHOULD be authenticated whenever
   possible.  Two IKE implementations which support the [KIV] document
   will be capable of doing this.  The Vendor ID for this revision of
   XAUTH is the following 8 bytes.

   Vendor ID = 0x09002689DFD6B712

   If an implementation receives the aforementioned Vendor ID, it can
   assume that the peer also has implemented this protocol and
   therefore is a "mutually consenting party".

   If this document ever advances to the standard-track, then new
   numbers will be assigned by IANA from the appropriate number spaces
   of [IKE] and [IKECFG], thus eliminating the need for a Vendor ID
   payload.




5. Extended Authentication Method

   This specification allows for extended authentication by allowing an
   edge device to request extended authentication from an IPsec host
   (end-node), thus forcing the host to respond with its extended
   authentication credentials.  The edge device will then respond with
   a failed or passed message.

   When the edge device requests extended authentication, it will
   specify the type of extra authentication and any parameters required
   for it.  These parameters MAY be the attributes that it requires for
   authentication and they MAY be information required for the IPsec
   host's reply (e.g. challenge string).

   The Extended Authentication transaction is terminated either when
   the edge device starts a SET/ACK exchange which includes an
   XAUTH_STATUS attribute or when the remote device sends a
   XAUTH_STATUS attribute in a REPLY message.  Please note that a
   remote device can not set XAUTH_STATUS to anything but FAIL.

   The edge device MAY request multiple different authentication
   transactions within one Extended Authentication transaction.  This
   is done by having multiple REQUEST/REPLY pairs, initiated by the
   edge device, before the transaction is terminated as described
   above.  Each REQUEST/REPLY pair MAY have a different value for
   XAUTH_TYPE.

       Extended Authentication with ISAKMP/Oakley October 2001


   As with CHAP [CHAP], this protocol can also be used to periodically
   authenticate the user during the lifetime of a security association.

   If the IPsec host does not have support for the authentication
   method requested by the edge device, then it would send back a REPLY
   with the XAUTH_STATUS attribute set to  FAIL, thus failing the
   authentication but completing the transaction.


   The Extended Authentication mechanism does not effect the nature of
   the phase 1 authentication mechanism in any way. Both peers MUST
   authenticate each other via the authentication methods described in
   [IKE] or some other authentication method in the ISAKMP framework.
   There are Security Considerations involved in at least one of the
   authentication methods in [IKE] and this is described in "Security
   Considerations" below.

   This method provides unidirectional authentication only, meaning
   that only one device is authenticated using both IKE authentication
   methods and Extended Authentication.

   Here are some types of extended authentication that this
   specification supports:



5.1 Simple Authentication

   Where a user name and password are required for authentication.

   IPsec Host                                              Edge Device
   --------------                                    -----------------
                                       <-- REQUEST(NAME="" PASSWORD="")
   REPLY(NAME="joe" PASSWORD="foobar") -->
                                                    <-- SET(STATUS=OK)
   ACK(STATUS) -->

   Some authentication mechanisms hide the user password by some type
   of encryption mechanism.


   IPsec Host                                              Edge Device
   --------------                                    -----------------
                                <-- REQUEST(TYPE=RADIUS-CHAP
                                CHALLENGE="123456" NAME="" PASSWORD="")
   REPLY(TYPE=RADIUS-CHAP NAME="joe" PASSWORD="E4901AB7") -->
                                                    <-- SET(STATUS=OK)
   ACK(STATUS) -->

   NOTE: This is a conceptual example of RADIUS-CHAP, for a more
   detailed example, see Appendix A.


5.2  Challenge/Response


Beaulieu, Pereira                                                    5

       Extended Authentication with ISAKMP/Oakley October 2001



   Where a challenge from the edge device must be incorporated with the
   reply.  This makes each reply different.

   IPsec Host                                              Edge Device
   --------------                                    -----------------
                                      <-- REQUEST(NAME="" PASSWORD="")
   REPLY(NAME="joe" PASSWORD="foobar") -->
                  <-- REQUEST(MESSAGE="Enter your password followed by
                                 your pin number" NAME="" PASSWORD="")
   REPLY(NAME="joe" PASSWORD="foobar0985124") -->
                                                    <-- SET(STATUS=OK)
   ACK(STATUS) -->

   If, however, the edge device knows that a challenge will be required
   it may skip the first exchange as follows:

   IPsec Host                                              Edge Device
   --------------                                    -----------------
                  <-- REQUEST(MESSAGE="Enter your password followed by
                                 your pin number" NAME="" PASSWORD="")
   REPLY(NAME="joe" PASSWORD="foobar0985124") -->
                                                    <-- SET(STATUS=OK)
   ACK(STATUS) -->

5.3 Two-Factor Authentication

   This authentication method combines something the user knows (their
   password) and something that the user has (a token card).

   IPsec Host                                             Edge Device
   --------------                                   -----------------
                          <-- REQUEST(NAME="" PASSWORD="" PASSCODE="")
   REPLY(NAME="joe" PASSWORD="foobar" PASSCODE="3412") -->
                                                    <-- SET(STATUS=OK)
   ACK(STATUS) -->

   Some mechanisms allow for another optional request of the passcode.

   IPsec Host                                              Edge Device
   --------------                                    -----------------
                          <-- REQUEST(NAME="" PASSWORD="" PASSCODE="")
   REPLY(NAME="joe" PASSWORD="foobar" PASSCODE="323415") -->
                          <-- REQUEST(NAME="" PASSWORD="" PASSCODE="")
   REPLY(NAME="joe" PASSWORD="foobar" PASSCODE="513212") -->
                                                    <-- SET(STATUS=OK)
   ACK(STATUS) -->
5.4 One-Time-Password

   Similar to the Challenge/Response method, this method allows
   authentication that is secure against passive attacks based on
   replaying captured passwords.

   IPsec Host                                              Edge Device

   ACK(STATUS) -->


5.5 User Previously Authenticated

   Some situations may occur where the edge device has already
   authenticated the host and no new authentication is required.  This
   may happen when either the host or the edge device must rekey an
   existing phase 1 SA.  It is important that this method not be used,
   unless the implementation can be sure that the current phase 1 SA
   was created with the same peer as the initial phase 1 SA, which was
   previously authenticated using XAUTH.  There is currently no way
   defined to ensure that two separate phase 1 SAs actually belong to
   the same peer.  One method suggested is to use the ID from the phase
   1 negotiation (available in Main Mode and Aggressive Mode) but only
   if the ID is unique to the user and cannot not be forged.  This
   concept is herein referred to as "ID-Checking".

   Implementation hint:

   o In order to accomplish ID-Checking for Phase 1 Authenticated With
   a Pre-Shared Key (as defined in [IKE]), the pre-shared key lookup
   must be based on the phase 1 ID.  Please note that this method only
   currently works for Aggressive Mode, and may work with modes defined
   in the future.  A static IP address could also be used for shared
   secret lookup, however, the binding of the user to XAUTH session
   would have to use the IP address instead of the ID.


   o In order to accomplish ID-Checking for IKE Phase 1 Authenticated
   With Signatures (as defined in [IKE]), the implementation must
   ensure that the ID provided in the phase 1 exchange matches the ID
   in the peer's certificate which must be signed by a trusted third
   party.



   In the situation where the peer does not require additional
   authentication, the following method is used.

   IPsec Host                                              Edge Device
   -------------                                      ----------------
                                                    <-- SET(STATUS=OK)
   ACK(STATUS) -->

5.6 Other Useful Examples

   More useful examples are found in Appendix A.


6 Extensions to ISAKMP-Config

   This protocol uses the mechanisms described in ISAKMP-Config
   [IKECFG] to accomplish its authentication transaction.  This
   protocol uses Configuration Attributes from the private range of
   Isakmp-Config [IKECFG].  To ensure interoperability with past and
   future versions of Extended Authentication, a Vendor ID is provided
   in section 2.

   All ISAKMP-Config messages in an extended authentication transaction
   MUST contain the same ISAKMP-Config transaction identifier.  The
   Message ID in the ISAKMP header follows the rules defined by the
   ISAKMP-Config protocol.

   This protocol can therefore be used in conjunction with any existing
   basic ISAKMP authentication method as defined in [IKE].

   This authentication MUST be used after a phase 1 exchange has
   completed and before any other exchange with the exception of Info
   mode exchanges. If the extended authentication fails, then the phase
   1 SA MUST be immediately deleted.  The edge device MAY choose to
   retry an extended authentication request if the user failed to be
   authenticated, but must do so in the same ISAKMP-Config transaction,
   and MUST NOT send the SET message until the user is authenticated,
   or until the edge device wishes to stop retrying and fail the user.

   Extended Authentication MAY be initiated by the edge device at any
   time after the initial authentication exchange.  For example, RADIUS
   servers may specify that a user only be authenticated for a certain
   time period.  Once that time period has elapsed (minus a possible
   jitter), the edge device may request a new Extended Authentication
   exchange.  If the Extended Authentication exchange fails, the edge
   device MUST tear down all phase 1 and phase 2 SAs associated with
   the user.

   The following are extensions to the ISAKMP-Config [IKECFG]
   specification to support Extended Authentication.

6.1 Message Types

   ISAKMP-CFG-REQUEST - This message is sent from an edge device to an
   IPsec host trying to request extended authentication.  Attributes
   that it requires sent back in the reply MUST be included with a
   length of zero (0).  Attributes required for the authentication
   reply, such as a challenge string MUST be included with the proper
   values filled in.

   ISAKMP-CFG-REPLY - This message MUST contain the filled in
   authentication attributes that were requested by the edge device or
   if the proper authentication attributes can not be retrieved, then
   this message MUST contain the XAUTH-STATUS attribute with a value of
   FAIL.

   ISAKMP-CFG-SET - This message is sent from an edge device and is
   only used, within the scope of this document, to state the success
   of the authentication.  This message MUST only include the success
   of failure of the authentication and MAY contain some clarification
   text.

   ISAKMP-CFG-ACK - This message is sent from the IPsec host
   acknowledging receipt of the authentication result.  Its attributes
   are not relevant and MAY be skipped entirely, thus no attributes
   SHOULD be included.  This last message in the authentication
   transaction is used solely as an acknowledgement of the previous
   message and to eliminate problems with unacknowledged messages over
   UDP.

6.2 Attributes

   format the strings.

   XAUTH-TYPE - The type of extended authentication requested whose
   values are described in the next section.  This is an optional
   attribute for the ISAKMP_CFG_REQUEST and ISAKMP_CFG_REPLY messages.
   If the XAUTH-TYPE is not present, then it is assumed to be Generic.
   The XAUTH-TYPE in a REPLY MUST be identical to the XAUTH-TYPE in the
   REQUEST.  If the XAUTH-TYPE was not present in the REQUEST, then it
   MUST NOT be present in the REPLY.  However, an XAUTH transaction MAY

   XAUTH-PASSCODE - A token card's passcode.

   XAUTH-MESSAGE - A textual message from an edge device to an IPsec
   host.  The message may contain a textual challenge or instruction.
   An example of this would be "Enter your password followed by your
   pin number".  The message may also contain a reason why
   authentication failed or succeeded.  This message SHOULD be
   displayed to the user.

   XAUTH-CHALLENGE - A challenge string sent from the edge device to
   the IPsec host for it to include in its calculation of a password.
   This attribute SHOULD only be sent in an ISAKMP-CFG-REQUEST message.
   Typically, the XAUTH-TYPE attribute dictates how the receiving
   device should handle the challenge.  For example, RADIUS-CHAP uses
   the challenge to hide the password.  The XAUTH-CHALLENGE attribute
   MUST NOT be used when XAUTH-TYPE is set to generic.

   XAUTH-DOMAIN - The domain to be authenticated in.  This value will
   have different meaning depending on the authentication type.

   XAUTH-STATUS - A variable that is used to denote authentication
   success (OK=1) or failure (FAIL=0).  This attribute MUST be sent in
   the ISAKMP-CFG-SET message, in which case it may be set to either OK
   or FAIL, and MAY be sent in a REPLY message by a remote peer, in
   which case it MUST be set to FAIL.

   XAUTH-NEXT-PIN - A variable which is used when the edge device is
   requesting that the user choose a new pin number.  This attribute
   MUST NOT be used in conjunction with any attributes other than
   XAUTH-MESSAGE and / or XAUTH-TYPE.

   XAUTH-ANSWER - A variable length ASCII string used to send input to
   the edge device.  An edge device MAY include this attribute in a
   REQUEST message in order to prompt an answer from the user, though
   it MUST be accompanied by an XAUTH-MESSAGE attribute. This attribute
   MUST NOT be used in conjunction with any attributes other than
   XAUTH-TYPE or XAUTH-MESSAGE.

       Extended Authentication with ISAKMP/Oakley October 2001


       0           Generic
       1           RADIUS-CHAP
       2           OTP
       3           S/KEY
       4-32767     Reserved for future use
       32768-65535  Reserved for private use

   Generic - A catch-all type that allows for future extensibility and
   a generic mechanism to request authentication information. This
   method allows for any type of extended authentication which does not
   require specific processing, and should be used whenever possible.
   This is the default setting if no XAUTH_TYPE is present.

   RADIUS-CHAP - RADIUS-CHAP is one method of authentication defined in
   [RADIUS] which uses a challenge to hide the password.  In order to
   use the CHAP functionality defined in [RADIUS], the XAUTH_TYPE MUST
   be set to RADIUS-CHAP.  For all other methods defined in [RADIUS]
   (i.e. PAP), the XAUTH_TYPE MUST be set to Generic.

   OTP - One-Time-Passwords as defined in [OTP] uses a challenge string
   to request a certain generated password.  The request SHOULD contain
   a user name, password and a challenge string while the reply MUST
   contain the user name and the generated password.  The challenge
   string is formatted as defined in [OTPEXT].
   S/KEY - This one-time-password scheme defined in [SKEY] was the
   precursor to OTP, thus the same rules applies.


7. XAUTH Notification

   It is important the edge device be able to notify the remote device
   of its intent to prompt for extended authentication.  If such a
   mechanism were not present, the remote device would send a Quick
   Mode message, or a Mode-Cfg message before authentication was
   complete, and the state machines would get pretty complicated.

   We present here two methods of accomplishing this.  The first is the
   simplest, and most intuitive.  However it is not possible to achieve
   this within the [IKE] protocol as it stands today, and is therefore
   not recommended.  It has been added to this document for
   completeness, and may be used in future versions of this document.

7.1 Notification payloads within a phase 1 exchange

   The following method is used to notify the remote device that an
   XAUTH exchange will follow the phase 1 exchange.  Once the edge
   device does a policy lookup for the peer, the edge device appends a
   notify payload to any phase 1 exchange packet, indicating that an
   XAUTH exchange will follow.  Note, that this notify payload is
   unauthenticated unless both devices support the mechanisms described
   in [KIV].  Therefore, implementations MUST NOT use this method
   unless they are also using the mechanisms described in [KIV].

       Extended Authentication with ISAKMP/Oakley October 2001


   Once again, this method is not part of the XAUTH protocol in its
   present form.  It has only been added here for completeness, and may
   be used in future versions of this document.

   No payload definitions, assigned numbers, or vendor ID payloads will
   be provided for this method, as it is currently not part of the
   XAUTH protocol.  These may be defined in the future if enough
   interest is shown, and if [KIV] becomes a standardized within the
   IPsec working group.

7.2 Notification via Authentication Method Types

   The following method is used to negotiate the use of XAUTH via the
   SA payload.  New authentication methods are defined which allow the
   edge device to choose an authentication method which mandates XAUTH.
   This allows the edge device to notify the remote device that an
   XAUTH exchange will follow the phase 1 exchange.  Edge devices which
   conform to this document MUST support this method.


   The following values relate to the ISAKMP authentication method
   attribute used in proposals.  They optionally allow an XAUTH
   implementation to propose use of extended authentication after the
   initial phase 1 authentication.  Values are taken from the private
   use range defined in [IKE] and should be used among mutually
   consenting parties.  To ensure interoperability and avoid
   collisions, a Vendor ID is provided in the "Vendor ID" section of
   this document.

    XAUTHRespRSA                                      65006
    XAUTHInitRSAEncryption                            65007
    XAUTHRespRSAEncryption                            65008
    XAUTHInitRSARevisedEncryption                     65009
    XAUTHRespRSARevisedEncryption                     65010


   An Extended Authentication proposal has two characteristics.

   The first is the direction of the authentication.  Each type
   identifies whether the Initiator or the Responder is the device
   which should be authenticated using XAUTH.  For example
   XAUTHInitPreShared is a type which demands that the Initiator be
   authenticated.

   Note that an edge device would typically initiate with one of the
   following:

Beaulieu, Pereira                                                   12

   o XAUTHRespPreShared
   o XAUTHRespDSS
   o XAUTHRespRSA
   o XAUTHRespRSAEncryption
   o XAUTHRespRSARevisedEncryption

   and would typically only accept proposals with the following
   authentication methods:
   o XAUTHInitPreShared
   o XAUTHInitDSS
   o XAUTHInitRSA
   o XAUTHInitRSAEncryption
   o XAUTHInitRSARevisedEncryption

   The second characteristic is the IKE Authentication method to be
   used.  The following table illustrates which keywords in the methods
   described above relate to which Authentication Methods described in
   [IKE] Appendix A.



   "PreShared"            -> pre-shared key
   "DSS"                  -> DSS signatures
   "RSA"                  -> RSA signatures
   "RSAEncryption"        -> Encryption with RSA
   "RSARevisedEncryption" -> Revised encryption with RSA


8. Other Scenarios for Extended Authentication

   Although this document described a scenario where an IPsec host (eg.
   mobile user) was being authenticated by an edge device (eg.
   firewall/gateway), the methods described can also be used for edge
   device to edge device authentication as well as IPsec host to IPsec
   host authentication.

9. Extensibility

   Although this protocol was initially developed for the corporate
   "Road Warrior" with a dynamic IP address to connect to a corporate
   Net, there may be certain applications where static IP addresses are
   used by the "Road Warrior" or where this protocol is used in a non
   remote-user environment where the IP address is static.  There are
   Security Considerations for certain applications of this protocol in
   certain deployment scenarios.  Please consult the "Security
   Considerations" section below for more detail.

   [IKE] defines many different ways to authenticate a user and
   generate keying material.  There are two basic phase 1 modes
   defined: Main Mode and Aggressive Mode.  There are also at least 5
   different authentication schemes which can be used with each mode.




Beaulieu, Pereira                                                   13

       Extended Authentication with ISAKMP/Oakley October 2001


   New authentication schemes are being developed and surely more will
   be standardized in the future.  Similarly new phase 1 modes are
   being proposed to address weaknesses or missing functionality in
   Main Mode and/or Aggressive mode.

   It is for this reason that XAUTH was designed to be fully
   extensible.  Since XAUTH extends the phase 1 authentication provided
   by [IKE], it is an important design goal that a legacy user
   authentication scheme in IPsec be able to use the strengths of
   current and future authentication and key generation schemes.

   XAUTH accomplishes this by working with all modes which allow the
   negotiation of a phase 1 authentication method in ISAKMP.  Any new
   authentication methods defined in the future which are not addressed
   by this document need simply to take values from the "consenting
   parties" ranges of [IKE].  Such an example would be the introduction
   of Encryption with El-Gamal and Revised Encryption with El-Gamal,
   and [HYBRID].  Furthermore, any new modes defined such as Base Mode,
   will automatically be able to use the functionality of XAUTH as no
   new numbers are needed.

   Finally, any new or forgotten Legacy User Authentication Schemes
   which are not part of XAUTH can be easily incorporated by taking
   numbers from the "consenting parties" ranges of XAUTH, or by
   requesting reserved numbers from IANA.



10. Security Considerations

   Care should be taken when sending sensitive information over public
   networks such as the Internet.  A user's password should never be
   sent in the clear and when sent encrypted, the destination MUST have
   been previously authenticated.  The use of ISAKMP-Config [IKECFG]
   addresses these issues.

   The protocol described in this memo strictly extends the
   authentication methods described in [IKE].  It does not in any way
   affect the authenticated nature of the phase 1 security association.
   In fact, this protocol heavily relies on the authenticated nature of
   the phase 1 SA.  Without complete phase 1 authentication, this
   protocol does not provide protection against man-in-the-middle
   attacks.  Therefore it MUST NOT be used without normal phase 1
   authentication.  This protocol was designed to be extensible, and
   can be used in many possible combinations of phase 1 Modes and
   authentication methods.  However, certain combinations of scenarios
   could lead to weaker than desired security, and are therefore
   discouraged.

   When using XAUTH with Pre-Shared keys, where the peer's IP address
   is dynamic, Main Mode SHOULD NOT be used, and is     STRONGLY
   DISCOURAGED. In this particular scenario, the phase 1 authentication
   becomes suspect as the administrator has little choice but to use

Beaulieu, Pereira                                                   14

       Extended Authentication with ISAKMP/Oakley October 2001


   one single Shared-Key for all users, and group-shared keys are
   susceptible to "social engineering attacks".

   However, the choice of implementation of this functionality is left
   up to the implementers of this protocol.  There may be some
   applications where this functionality is desired.  Some examples
   are: proof of concept deployments and small deployments where the
   proper management of a group shared-key is less difficult.

   If at some point restrictions are introduced in one of the IPsec
   Standard RFC documents which prohibit the use of group pre-shared
   keys, then this protocol will, by default, conform, and these
   Security Considerations will no longer be of concern.

Appendix A


   This appendix gives more useful examples of Extended Authentication.

   SDI through RADIUS
   ==================

   The following 3 examples show examples of SDI running through
   RADIUS.  Since the edge device does not necessarily know that we are
   indeed doing SDI, the edge device will typically send everything in
   terms of Username and Password.  This of course results in the user
   being prompted with a password dialog when it isn't really a
   password which is required.  This tends to be a little confusing,
   but it is really a limitation of RADIUS.

   NOTE: The edge device may choose to try and detect these situations
   and send better suited XAUTH attributes (such as XAUTH ANSWER or
   XAUTH NEXT PIN).  The Client is typically protocol agnostic and will
   prompt the user for whatever attributes the edge device requests.



   Example A-1:
   ============
   Secure ID Next PIN mode via RADIUS (Scenario 1 - SDI generated next
   pin)

   IPsec Client                                          IPsec Gateway
   ------------                                          -------------
                             <-- REQUEST(Username = '', Password = '')
   REPLY(Username = 'joe', Password = '1637364856') -->
                        <-- REQUEST(Username = '', Password = '',
                        XAUTH_MESSAGE = 'The system has assigned you a
                        new PIN of '1234', please re-enter your
                        username and password')
   REPLY(Username = 'joe', Password = '1234764456') -->
                                            <-- SET(XAUTH_STATUS = OK)
   ACK(XAUTH_STATUS) -->

   Example A-2:
   ============
   Secure ID Next PIN mode via RADIUS (Scenario 2 - User generated next
   pin)

   IPsec Client                                          IPsec Gateway

                             <-- REQUEST(Username = '', Password = '')
   REPLY(Username = 'joe', Password = '1637364856') -->
                        <-- REQUEST(Username = '', Password = '',
                        XAUTH_MESSAGE = 'Enter your new PIN containing
                        4-6 digits')
   REPLY(Username = 'joe', Password = '1234') -->

                        PIN.  Would you like to generate your own PIN
                        (y/n)?)
   REPLY(Username = 'joe', Password = 'y') -->
                        <-- REQUEST(Username = '', Password = '', XAUTH
                        MESSAGE = 'Enter your new PIN containing 4-6
                        digits')
   REPLY(Username = 'joe', Password = '1234') -->
                              <-- REQUEST(Username = '', Password = '')
   REPLY(Username = 'joe', Password = '1234764456'

   ACK(XAUTH_STATUS) -->



   Native SDI
   ==========

   When doing native SDI between the edge device and the SDI server,
   the edge device has more information about what type of information
   is required from the user.  The edge device can therefore use more
   intuitive attributes in certain situations as compared with the
   RADIUS examples above.
