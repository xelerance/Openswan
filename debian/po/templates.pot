"Previous versions of the Openswan package gave a choice between three "
"different Start/Stop-Levels. Due to changes in the standard system startup "
"procedure, this is no longer necessary or useful. For all new installations "
"as well as old ones running in any of the predefined modes, sane default "
"levels will now be set. If you are upgrading from a previous version and "
"changed your Openswan startup parameters, then please take a look at NEWS."
"Debian for instructions on how to modify your setup accordingly."

"Restarting Openswan is recommended, since if there is a security fix, it "
"will not be applied until the daemon restarts. Most people expect the daemon "
"to restart, so this is generally a good idea. However, this might take down "
"existing connections and then bring them back up, so if you are using such "
"an Openswan tunnel to connect for this update, restarting is not recommended."

msgid ""
"An X.509 certificate for this host can be automatically created or imported. "
"It can be used to authenticate IPsec connections to other hosts and is the "
"preferred way of building up secure IPsec connections. The other possibility "
"would be to use shared secrets (passwords that are the same on both sides of "
"the tunnel) for authenticating a connection, but for a larger number of "
"connections, key based authentication is easier to administer and more "
"secure."
