openswan (1:2.6.24+dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=low

  Plain RSA key creation has been removed from debconf as they do not really
  provide interoperability with other IPsec implementations and nowadays X.509
  certificates are the de-facto standard. If there is still the need to
  create such a key please take a look at README.Debian on how to manually
  build and include it in the configuration.

openswan (1:2.6.24+dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  Support for choosing between different Start/Stop-Levels for Openswan was
  finally removed since it is really obsolete. The system startup nowadays
  has the three different points at which the init script could be called
  streamlined as a set of sequently running scripts in system runlevel S.
  Furthermore the syslog-service on which Openswan depends is only started
  in normal runlevels 2-5, so starting IPsec earlier would make little sense
  anyway.

  Please note that existing starting configurations which have been modified
  are not changed by an upgrade, this must be done manually done by the system 
  administrator issuing the commands "update-rc.d -f ipsec remove" and
  "update-rc.d -f ipsec defaults 16 84".

  Additionally, the way in which plain RSA key creation is managed was
  changed. As debconf should not modify files marked as configs now when such
  a key gets created it is saved under /var/lib/openswan/ipsec.secrets.inc.
  This file in turn is included per default in /etc/ipsec.secrets. Also note
  that from now on X.509 certificates which get created or are imported via
  debconf will be registered too in the new include file.

openswan (1:2.6.22+dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=HIGH

  NAT-Traversal for kernels >= 2.6.23 is now included in the ipsec.ko module,
  eliminating the need for patching. There are no configuration changes
  necessary to activate it, pluto will automatically try to use it.

  Please note that this does not apply to kernels < 2.6.23, here you will
  still need apply a custom NAT-T patch.
