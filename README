#            Openswan 2.X Release Notes
#########################################################################

Openswan is an IPsec implementation for Linux. It has support for most 
of the extensions (RFC + IETF drafts) related to IPsec, including 
IKEv2, X.509 Digital Certificates, NAT Traversal, and many others.

Openswan was originally based on FreeS/WAN 2.04 CVS with the X.509 Patch
from Andreas Steffen, the NAT-T patch from Arkoon networks and some minor
bug fixes from 2.05 and 2.06.  See CREDITS for the history.

# REQUIREMENTS
#########################################################################

A recent Linux distribution based on either Kernel 2.4.x, or 2.6.x are 
the currently supported platforms.

Most recent distributions have package support for openswan.  Unless
a source based build is truly needed,  it is often best to use the pre-built
distributions packaged version.

There are a few packages required for Openswan to compile from source:

1. The GNU Math Precision Library:

   Debian package names: libgmp-dev
   Rpm package names:    gmp, gmp-devel

   Rpm users may need to install gcc if it is not installed on their system already

2. make, flex and bison:

   Debian package names: make, flex, bison
   Rpm package names:    same as for Debian

3. iproute2, iptables, sed, awk, bash, cut and possibly other tools
   are required at runtime.

   Debian package names: iproute2, iptables, the rest are usually there
   Rpm package names:    same as for Debian

   python is also required for "ipsec verify".

4. Running unit test:

   Debian package names: libpcap0.8-dev, libpcap0.8, electric-fence, tcpdump
   Rpm package names:    libpcap, libpcap-devel, ElectricFence, tcpdump

5. Building with LIBNSS:

   Debian package names: libnspr4-dev, libnss3-dev, libnss3-tools
   Rpm package names:    same as for Debian

# HOW TO INSTALL on Kernel 2.6 (And Kernels with 2.6 IPsec backport)
#########################################################################

NETKEY (Native linux IPsec stack)
---------------------------------

To use Openswan with the linux native (builtin) IPsec stack,  then the
following steps should be all that are needed. Please use at least kernel
version 2.6.9, as prior versions of the kernel have serious bugs in the
native IPsec stack.  From the Openswan directory:

    make programs
    sudo make install

Note: The ipsec-tools package is no longer needed. Instead iproute2 >= 2.6.8
is required. For backported kernels, setkey and thus ipsec-tools might still
be required. Run 'ipsec verify' to determine if your system has either one
of the requirements.

KLIPS/KLIPSNG (Openswan IPsec stack)
------------------------------------

To use the Openswan KLIPS IPsec stack (ipsec0 devices) for Linux
Kernels 2.6.23 and higher, the following steps should work.  From the
Openswan directory:

    make programs
    make KERNELSRC=/lib/modules/`uname -r`/build module
    sudo make KERNELSRC=/lib/modules/`uname -r`/build install minstall

For Linux 2.6 Kernels before 2.6.23, including 2.4 linux systems, the kernel
requires patching if NAT-T support or SAref tracking is required. Full kernel
source will be required as the kernel sources are being patched, built and
installed.  It is good practice to build and install an unpatched kernel
before starting to ensure the process is correct.  See your distribution
documentation on how to build and install a new kernel

    Determine the linux source directory,  for example /usr/src/linux on
    most full source installs.  It may also be /usr/src/linux-2.[46].X

    Add NAT-T support (if required).

        From the Openswan source directory:

          make KERNELSRC=/usr/src/linux nattpatch | patch -d /usr/src/linux -p1

    Add SAref tracking support (if required).

        Premade patches for some distributions kernels can be found in
        patches/kernel/  It is recommended that kernel 2.6.32 or higher is
        used. Documentation on SAref/MAST can be found in docs/HACKING/Mast*
        and doc/klips/mast.xml. To understand what SAref tracking does, see
        doc/ipsecsaref.png and the overlapip= entry in the ipsec.conf man page.

        From the Openswan source directory:

          make KERNELSRC=/usr/src/linux sarefpatch | patch -d /usr/src/linux -p1

    Add OCF HW offloading support

        For OCF HW offloading support, you need also need a patched kernel
        See: http://ocf-linux.sourceforge.net/ for more details.

    Build and install a new kernel

        See your distribution documentation on how to install a new kernel.
        It should be something similar to:

          cd /usr/src/linux
          make oldconfig
          make dep                    - this step is ignore on 2.6 systems)
          make bzImage install

    Build Openswan

        From the Openswan source directory:

            make programs
            make KERNELSRC=/usr/src/linux module
            sudo make KERNELSRC=/usr/src/linux install minstall

The Openswan configuration file can select which ipsec stack to use at
runtime by using the "protostack=<klips|netkey|mast>" options in ipsec.conf.
See the ipsec.conf man page for more information on configuration options.

# UPGRADING
#########################################################################

1. If you are upgrading from a 1.x product to Openswan 2.x, you will
   need to adjust your config files.  See doc/upgrading.html for details
   on what has changed.

2. You can 'make install' overtop of your old version - it won't replace
   your /etc/ipsec.* config files
