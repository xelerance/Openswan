# About

This document describes how to initiate connections back into
overlapping IP address ranges of multiple clients when using mast mode
with `IP_IPSEC_BINDREF`.

Openswan comes with two SAref patches.  One adds support for setting
SAref on a packet as it's sent, and retrieving it from a packet when
it's received.  This works fine for UDP when using `sendmsg()` and
`recvmsg()`.

For TCP, or a connected UDP socket, the SAref needs to be assigned, or
bound, to a socket.  Any data written to the socket using `write()` will
be sent via the assigned SAref.  This feature works the same with simple
tunnels as well as nested tunnels.  The SAref used needs to be the inner
most SA.

The `IP_IPSEC_BINDREF` patch is needed for connected sockets.


# The setup

For examples in this document we will use 3 systems: 2 clients with
private networks, connecting to a central aggregation point.

                          ,-- client1 ---- (private1)
    server ---- (internet)
                          `-- client2 ---- (private2)

The clients will initiate the connection to the server, and the
`internet` could include one ore more NAT points.  Furthermore, the
private networks behind the clients terminating the connection could
overlap.  Under normal circumstances it would be impossible for the
server to initiate a connection to, or in some cases reply to packets
originating from, the private networks.

Here is an example ipsec.conf `conn` entry:

    conn server-client1
        left=server.foo.com
        leftid=@server.foo.com
        leftrsasigkey=0s...
        #
        right=%any
        rightsubnet=192.168.0.0/24
        rightid=@client1.foo.com
        rightrsasigkey=0s...
        #
        type=tunnel
        overlapip=yes
        auto=add


# Normal connections

Incoming packets are relatively easy to match up with SAs, because the
ESP header carries this information.  Outgoing packets requires a table
that maps the original packet header fields to the SA to use for IPsec.
In non-mast mode, klips uses an eroute table, while in mast-mode
openswan uses iptables to manage this list.

When a packet is sent out, it will pass through iptables.  Openswan
maintains an IPSEC chain in the mangle table.  This allows it to tag
packets using xmark (previously nfmark).  When klips, in mast mode, sees
a packet that's marked with an nfmark, it will use that information to
lookup the SA that will be used to tunnel/transport this packet.


# Unconnected sockets

Servers, such as xl2tpd, which accept UDP connections from many peers
use a single connectionless datagram socket, and address packets using
`sendmsg()`.  As described in the openswan `MastRework` document, mast
mode allows for each packet sent via `sendmsg()` to be tagged with a
SAref by using the `IP_IPSEC_REFINFO` option of `msghdr`.

    struct msghdr msgh;
    struct cmsghdr *cmsg;
    unsigned int saref = 1234;  // soem SAref

    ...

    cmsg = CMSG_FIRSTHDR(&msgh);
    cmsg->cmsg_level = IPPROTO_IP;
    cmsg->cmsg_type  = IP_IPSEC_REFINFO;
    cmsg->cmsg_len   = CMSG_LEN(sizeof(unsigned int));
    *((unsigned int *)CMSG_DATA(cmsg)) = saref;

    ...

    rc = sendmsg(socket, &msg, 0);

(refer to `sendmsg` manpage for further info)

When klips, operating in mast mode, sees a packet with this SAref, it
will use it to lookup the SA to send the packet on.  It is thus possible
to send packets to the same IP behind two different tunnels, since the
tunneled destination IP is not used for routing or SA selection.

On the incoming path, `recvmsg()` is used to read data.  The `recvmsg()`
system call also uses the `struct msghdr` to pass the SAref of a packet,
but int he opposite direction.  But before calling `recvmsg()`, a socket
needs to be told that the caller is interested in SAref info.

    unsigned int arg = 1;
    rc = setsockopt(socket, IPPROTO_IP, IP_IPSEC_REFINFO, &arg, sizeof(arg));

After that, each call to `recvmsg()` will return a `cmsg` with the SAref
used.

    struct msghdr msgh;
    struct cmsghdr *cmsg;
    unsigned int saref = 0;

    ...

    rc = recvmsg(socket, &msg, 0);

    ...

    for (cmsg = CMSG_FIRSTHDR(&msgh); cmsg; cmsg = CMSG_NXTHDR(&msgh,cmsg)) {
        if (cmsg->cmsg_level == IPPROTO_IP
                && cmsg->cmsg_type == IP_IPSEC_REFINFO) {
            saref = *((unsigned int *)CMSG_DATA(cmsg));
        }
    }

See xl2tpd sources for further examples of using `IP_IPSEC_REFINFO` to
set and get SAref for UDP datagram packets.


# Connected sockets

For TCP and connected UDP sockets, the socket only has one end point,
and there is no room for selecting the SA on each packet.  Instead the
socket is "bound" to the SAref using the `IP_IPSEC_BINDREF` socket
option:

    rc = setsockopt(socket, IPPROTO_IP, IP_IPSEC_BINDREF, &saref, sizeof(saref));

This has a similar effect to setting the SAref for each UDP datagram,
but needs only be done once.  Next, the aggregation-server software
would call `connect()` to connect to a listening port in the private
network through the tunnel selected by the SAref.  Finally, `read()` and
`write()` would be used to receive and send data.

Openswan comes with two examples under `contrib` that use this feature.

 - `sarefnc` - netcat modified to use a `-S <saref>` option
 - `ldsaref` - an `LD_PRELOAD` library that can be used to wrap unmodified applications


# Optimizations

As described in the `MastRework2` document, to reduce the overhead of
traversing the iptables `IPSEC` chain openswan uses conntrack to assign
SAref numbers to packets that belong to connections.  This is an
improvement most notable on long connections.  For short connections
it's still expensive for iptables to traverse (potentially) thousands of
entries in the `IPSEC` chain to find the matching entry.

If the "server" peer will always use `IP_IPSEC_REFINFO` or
`IP_IPSEC_BINDREF`, it's not necessary to use the `IPSEC` table at all.
That is, if all applications that are trying to contact peers through
tunnels will be ones that are SAref aware, then the `ipsec/_updown.mast`
scripts can be modified to never update the IPSEC table.  Instead route
everything to be secured by IPsec through the mast interface, but make
sure that the SAref was set by the application.
